molony virus based reverse transcriptases (RT). The plasmid used contains a reverse transcriptase gene which is derived from Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus. The enzyme when expressed recombinantly can synthesizes a complementary DNA strand from single-stranded RNA, DNA, or an RNA:DNA hybrid.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Enzyme Engineering:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The enzyme contains point mutations to \ufeffgenerate a highly processive, thermostable, and improved fidelity mutant reverse transcriptase. Details, incluiding the sequence of this enzyme are published and can be found in the references below and addgene link. The <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">enzyme contains an active RNAse H domain and is highly thermostable<\/span><span>. This MMLV construct contains the following mutations: D200N, L603W, T330P, L139P, E607K,D524G, E562Q, D583N and D653N. These appear to be the same set of mutations present in the <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Thermo Fisher Maxima H- RT<\/span><span>, which is one of the best preforming RTs you can buy. The enzyme in our hands is extremely active. Moreover, while the MMLV RT is thermostable and will work up to 65\u00b0C it runs optimally at 42\u00b0C.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The point muitations utilized here are currently filed under a provisional patent with Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Thermo Product information brochure from 2013 suggest that this mutant or some combintation of other identified point mutations from reference 2 is Maxima RT, Maxima H-. The paper has also identified a few more useful point mutations which may further optimise MMLV-RT<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This expression protocol can also implemented to express other MMLV based reverse transcriptases or diversely related retroviral RTs, provided the genes are in an expresison construct with an N- terminal 6-10 His Tag and are expressed under a T7 promoter.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The plasmid used can be found on reclone.org and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.addgene.org\/153312\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">addgene<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">SkiBar H+ RT was synthesized as a gBlock from IDT and is codon optimized.
