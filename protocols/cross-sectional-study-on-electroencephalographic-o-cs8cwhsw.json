This fluctuation reflects the interaction between the autonomic nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Cardiac coherence is a state in which the HRV is around 0.1hz, a value associated with positive emotions and sought in various therapeutic interventions (Thayer et al., 2009). Cardiac coherence implies a regular synchronization between various physiological functions, such as blood pressure, respiratory rate and heart rate (Shaffer and Ginsberg, 2017). Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technique that measures the electrical activity of the brain and has acquired great relevance in the clinical field of psychiatry. For example, alpha asymmetry has been related to positive or negative emotions depending on the predominance in the left or right hemisphere, respectively (Davidson, 1992). However, studies on the cardiovascular system and the central nervous system are often fragmented, addressing these systems in isolation. Currently, little is known about the electrophysiological processes involved in cardiac coherence and what electroencephalographic variables are affected by this technique.\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"evams\",\"text\":\"To understand pathological states, it is necessary to understand normal physiology, as it is on it that therapeutic interventions are based. In this context, electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation stand out as strategies that have shown that modulating brain electrical activity can be an important goal in addressing mental disorders (leforcheur, 2020). Moreover, experimental studies using brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have demonstrated that frontal alpha asymmetry can be modulated by cognitive strategies (Krogmeier et al., 2022). EEG has multiple current and potential clinical applications in psychiatry, and it is a promising field that aims to increase objectivity. Therefore, it is essential to explore, identify and characterize more electrophysiological variables that have clinical relevance and can be targeted by different techniques.\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"d636i\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"53lkp\",\"text\":\"An integrative perspective that adheres to the positivist approach of the scientific method requires a continual pursuit of knowledge to enhance the comprehensive understanding of various physiological phenomena (Chakravarthy, 2020). Historically, the concept of \\\"emotional well-being\\\" has been associated with a dualistic epistemology that has impeded the empirical and monistic investigation of emotions in science (Damasio, 1994). For instance, the WHO defines mental health as \\\"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\\\" (World Health Organization, n.d.). This definition specifies the capabilities of an individual with mental well-being but does not delineate well-being itself. Despite the extensive literature on the impact of heart coherence on emotional self-regulation, anxiety reduction, and psychosocial well-being (McCraty, 2017), the relationship between heart coherence and electroencephalographic oscillations remains poorly understood and warrants further exploration. As suggested, frontal alpha asymmetry can be altered by neurofeedback, and other electrophysiological variables with clinical relevance may be amenable to different interventions. However, prior to that, it is essential to locate, identify and characterize them (Aftanas \\u0026 Golocheikine, 2001).

EEG measurements will be taken before and during the application of the heart coherence technique, with participants comfortably seated in a chair with their eyes closed. During the measurement, a mobile application designed for this purpose will provide instructions for breathing, following a specific pattern. The intervention will last between 5-15 minutes and will be performed in an individual session in a quiet and distraction-free environment. Heart coherence will be measured using a portable heart rate sensor. The control group will remain in the same space for the same amount of time, without being exposed to the strategy. Electrodes will be placed on specific points on the participant's head using the international 10/20 system manual, measuring activity in the central, parietal, temporal, occipital, and ocular signals. An electrooculogram (EOG) and ground electrode will be applied to the forehead, and exfoliating gel will be used to reduce skin resistance. All electrodes will be fixed with conductive paste, ensuring that impedances do not exceed 5 kΩ. An initial EEG measurement will be recorded in the absence of heart coherence at the start of the session (measuring VFC). Then, participants will be asked to sit in front of a monitor displaying a visual feedback signal (heart rate variability) based on real-time analysis of their electrofisiological data. Participants will follow the breathing and cursor on screen until obtaining a sinusoidal pattern registration, considered to have achieved heart coherence. At this point, they will be asked to close their eyes and maintain heart coherence for a second measurement. Data collection will be performed using a computer with an EEG amplifier. The signal will be processed and analyzed using the EEGLAB toolkit of MATLAB, defining four frequency bands for subsequent analysis: delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz).
