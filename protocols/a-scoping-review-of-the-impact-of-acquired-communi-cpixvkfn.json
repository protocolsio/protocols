Communication ability has been linked to ability to participate in consent-related discussions, sexual health and safety, sexual self-esteem and self-efficacy, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. It therefore makes sense that people with acquired communication impairments would experience changes to their sexual wellbeing as a result of the communication impairment. Additionally, healthcare clinicians may perceive the communication impairment as reducing the client's ability to discuss sexuality and sexual health. This may make sexual wellness even more difficult to access for people with acquired communication impairments. Therefore, this scoping review will be undertaken to better understand the scope of the literature relating acquired communication impairments to sexuality and how these impacts are discussed in the literature. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"nhmv\",\"text\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"9g82k\",\"text\":\"Methods \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"20eva\",\"text\":\"We will use Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework for a scoping review.
