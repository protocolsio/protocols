Although neuroplasticity is more commonly associated with the cerebral cortex, all parts of the nervous system, including the spinal cord, demonstrate plasticity, such as synaptic learning and memory mechanisms, dendritic pruning, collateral sprouting and axonal regeneration.Another factor that influences and regulates neuroplasticity is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most important functions of which are the regulation of synaptogenesis, neuroprotection and increased dendritic branching. BDNF also exerts an influence on the functional and structural aspects of synaptic transmission. Rehabilitation induces neuroplasticity, which is demonstrated by improved functional performance and an increase in BDNF. Protein expression of BDNF will be quantified from the saliva samples using the ELISA technique. A DELUXE HUMAN commercial kit (BioLegend\u00ae) will be used and the analysis will be performed following to the manufacturer's instructions.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1593528998}
