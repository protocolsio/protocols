Tandem lesion, loss to follow-up after discharge and a severe or fatal combined illness before AIS were excluded. The primary outcome was the “non-poor” outcome rate at 3 months and postprocedural symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04986774.Between August 2019 and May 2021, 85 eligible patients were comprised of 82 (96.5%) successful recanalization and 4 (4.7%) sICH. “Non-poor” outcome comprising of good (mRS 0 - ≤ 2) and fair (mRS 3). “Non-poor” outcome at 3 months occurred 47 (55.3%), in which there were 35 (41.2%) good outcome.

If after identifying large artery occlusion because of thrombus by SWI sequence or/ and angiography, the most commonly mechanical thrombectomy used was aspiration or combining aspiration with stent retriever.

If mechanical thrombectomy recanalization failure (mTICI \\u003c 2b) or large vessel severe stenosis after angiography (measured by WASID method with severe from 70 to 99%), we decided to stent after using a dual antiplatelet loading dose (300 mg clopidogrel and 162 mg aspirin) like Chang’s study (aspirin, 100 - 500 mg and clopidogrel, 300 mg) via nasogastric tube. Besides, during the procedure, intravenous heparin bolus 3000 - 5000 unit was given to patients to maintain a target activated clotting time of 250 to 300 seconds. Like the angioplasty protocol of WEAVE trial, we used the balloon size with nominal diameter to be 80% of the true luminal one or about 60% in lesions near visible perforators. After deploying the stent, if the residual stenosis remained ≥50%, we could dilate balloon within the stent.
