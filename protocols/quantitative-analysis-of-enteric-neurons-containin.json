the humane use of animals. The experimental procedures were approved by University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Chancellor\u2019s Animal Research Committee (ARC) (protocol 2018-074-01), and all efforts were made to avoid suffering. Specimens were obtained from 12 hours fasted 15 male castrated Yucatan minipigs (average weight 25-30 Kg of body weight). All animals were anaesthetized by intramuscular application of midazolam (1 mg\/kg, cat # 067595, Covetrus, Dublin, OH), ketamine (15 mg\/kg, cat # 068317, Covetrus, Dublin, OH) and meloxicam (0.3 mg\/kg, #049755, Covetrus, Dublin, OH). These animals were first used for colonic motility analysis with manometry probes apposed on the serosa, then tissues were collected 10-20 cm distally 5 hours post induction of anesthesia. The ascending colon (AC) in correspondence to the central flexure and descending colon (DC) (about 30 cm from the anus) were collected. We have compared these tissues to specimens collected  6 immediately after induction of anesthesia and we have not seen differences in the total density of enteric neurons and the localization of different neuronal markers, thus providing assurance that this procedure did not affect neuronal distribution and neurochemical expression. The samples were immersed in 0.01 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.0) containing the Ltype calcium channel blocker, nicardipine (20 mM) for 15-40 min. The tissues were then opened along the mesenteric border, vigorously flushed out with PBS and pinned tightly on balsa wood, mucosal surface facing down. Specimens were subsequently fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% picric acid in PBS at 4 \u00b0C overnight, removed from the balsa wood, washed (3 x 10 min) in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by washing in PBS (3 x 10 min) and stored at 4 \u00b0C in PBS containing sodium azide (0.1%). Wholemount preparations of the MP were obtained by separating the longitudinal muscle layer with attached the MP from the submucosa and mucosa using a dissecting microscope. The mucosa was removed from the submucosa and the submucosal layer was separated into the inner (ISP) and outer (OSP) parts of the submucosal plexus. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":[],"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":928412,"guid":"49012620898111EAB0824F3CC55405A7","previous_id":928410,"previous_guid":"4288A7A0898111EAB0824F3CC55405A7","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"48D50FEE7F39445A853A2FEC9F497A3B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Immunohistochemistry"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"4279FEEECE6F458A90FC70E908B1A480","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"Description","source":{"description":""}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":[],"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":928413,"guid":"529BA520898111EAB0824F3CC55405A7","previous_id":928412,"previous_guid":"49012620898111EAB0824F3CC55405A7","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"E3C06873B2D949F0A56B62263A36DA39","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Immunohistochemistry"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"5FA55717D0214CF397E9E45515681FD0","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">In order to establish the total number of neurons in each plexus and the distribution of subclasses of neurons, HuC\/D, ChAT and nNOS primary antibodies were used (Table 1). Initial single labeling immunofluorescence experiments determined each individual antibody best dilution and incubation time. Wholemount preparations were incubated in 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS containing 1% Triton-X100 and 1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature (RT) to reduce nonspecific binding of the secondary antibodies and to permeabilize the tissue to the antisera. All primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 1% Triton-X100 and 3% NGS. All secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 3% NGS. Tissues were then incubated at 4\u00b0C in a humid chamber for 2 days with the primary antibody (e.g. mouse anti-HuC\/D), washed in PBS (3 x 10 min), and incubated for 3 hours at RT in a humid  7 chamber in a solution containing the secondary antibody (e.g. goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 or 405) (Table 1). For double and triple-labeling experiments, we used the sequential staining procedure (Ho et al. 2003), which has been shown to produce the best staining\/ background ratio and allow the use of two mouse monoclonal antibodies in the same preparation. For double labeling, tissue was first incubated with the first antibody (e.g. mouse anti-NOS or rabbit anti-ChAT), followed by goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488, then incubated with mouse anti-Hu C\/D followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594. For triple labeling, tissue was first incubated with the first antibody (e.g. rabbit anti-ChAT), followed by goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488, then incubated with mouse anti-NOS, followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594, finally incubated with mouse anti-Hu C\/D, followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor\u00ae 405, then mounted on gelatin-coated slides with ProLongTM Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen).

class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The enteric nervous system (ENS) controls gastrointestinal functions. In large mammals\u2019 intestine, it comprises an inner (ISP) and outer (OSP) submucous plexus and a myenteric plexus (MP). This study quantifies enteric neurons in the ISP, OSP and MP of the pig ascending (AC) and descending colon (DC) using the HuC\/D, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) neuronal markers in wholemount preparations with multiple lbeling immunoflorescence. We established that the ISP contains the highest number of HuC\/D neurons\/mm2 , which were more abundant in AC vs. DC, followed by OSP and MP with similar density in AC and DC. In the ISP, the density of ChAT immunoreactive (IR) neurons was very similar in AC and DC (31% and 35%), nNOS-IR neurons were less abundant in AC than DC (15% vs. 42%, P< 0.001) and ChAT\/nNOS-IR neurons were 5% and 10%, respectively. In the OSP, 39-44% of neurons were ChAT-IR in AC and DC, while 45% and 38% were nNOS-IR and 10- 15% were ChAT\/nNOS-IR (AC vs. DC P< 0.05). In the MP, ChAT-IR neurons were 44% in AC and 54% in DC (P< 0.05), nNOS-IR neurons were 50% in both and ChAT\/nNOS-IR neurons were 12 and 16%, respectively. The ENS architecture with multilayered submucosal plexuses and the distribution of functionally distinct groups of neurons in the pig colon are similar to humans, supporting the suitability of the pig as a model and providing the platform for investigating the mechanisms underlying human colonic diseases<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1633401267}
