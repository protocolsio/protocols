A typical run consists of a sensor check, in which the biosensors are incubated in BLI-100 buffer. Then a Loading step, where the biosensors are transferred to a DNA-containing mixture. This is followed by a Baseline step, where the biosensors are transferred back to BLI-100 buffer. Next, we perform an Association step, in which the biosensors are moved to a protein-containing mixture. Finally, the biosensors are moved to a fresh BLI-100 buffer for a Dissociation step.

Most BLI instruments, such as the Octet RED96e used throughout this protocol, are completely automated and detect changes in the interference pattern of white light reflected off a biosensor tip. Biosensors are initially loaded with a stationary macromolecule, then introduced into a solution containing macromolecules of interest. Binding to the stationary molecules creates a change in optical wavelength that is recorded by the instrument in real-time. The majority of published BLI experiments assess protein-protein (such as antibody-substrate kinetics) or protein-small molecule (such as drug discovery) interactions. However, a less-appreciated assay for BLI analysis is DNA-protein interactions. In our laboratory, we have shown the practicality of using biotinylated-DNA probes to determine the binding kinetics of transcription factors to specific DNA sequences. The following protocol describes these steps, including the generation of biotinylated-DNA probes, the execution of the BLI experiment, and data analysis through GraphPad Prism.  <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1632750938}
