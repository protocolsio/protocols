Avoid picking up any lumps of tissue that might still be present, as these will stop the PCR from working. The best way to do this is to set your pipette to 1ul, depress the plunger, then slide the tip of your yellow tip down the side of the tube until it enters the liquid at the meniscus. At this point, gently raise the plunger to pick up 1ul and move it to the PCR mixture in tube 2.  Make sure you are holding the tubes up to eye level, so you can see what is happening.  For example, it is really helpful if you see the 1ul in the tip, and can see that you have actually transferred it to the PCR mix.  Seeing is believing.
