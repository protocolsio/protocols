During the analysis, changes in the light transmission of platelet-rich plasma are recorded as a result of the interaction of platelets through the IIb \/ IIIa glycoprotein receptors in response to stimulation by the inducer. The work of optical aggregometer is based on this principle. When assessing platelet aggregation according to G. Born and J. O'Brien, platelets are activated at 37\u00b0C by adding one of the agonists (1,2). Then, platelet aggregation occurs and transparency in the blood sample increases, which leads to an increase in the aggregation curve.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1614960365}
