Therefore, it was believed that the presence of esterase, the main enzyme that catalyze the hydrolysis of the diacetic groups, is required to convert CFDA-SE to fluorescent CFSE(Wang, Duan, Liu, Fang, & Tan, 2005). However, the presence of the enzymes only accelerates the hydrolysis of CFDA-SE, due to being catalysts of this hydrolysis. Contrary to common misconceptions, esterases are<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">not required<\/span><span>for this hydrolysis, and other factors such as high CFSE concentration, long incubation times and high temperatures, can also promote hydrolysis of the diacetic groups(Bergsdorf, Beyer, Umansky, Werr, & Sapp, 2003; Hoefel, Grooby, Monis, Andrews, & Saint, 2003). Thus, the approach that is taken in this protocol has been optimized for staining cell culture-derived EVs with a fluorescent dye, regardless of the concentration of esterases in the EVs(Morales-Kastresana et al., 2017).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The following protocol was developed to bulk stain EV populations(Thery et al., 2001; Thery, Ostrowski, & Segura, 2009). The protocol was optimized for achieving good signal to noise ratios, while avoiding excessive loss of EVs(Morales-Kastresana et al., 2017). To maximize the fluorescent intensity of the EVs, the authors recommend using CFDA-SE aliquots prepared in DMSO rather than aqueous solutions, which minimize fluorescein quenching with light and loss of diacetic groups by hydrolysis, which will render the molecule less permeant(Banks et al., 2013). This protocol can be performed in non-sterile conditions, although appropriate handling of reagents to ensure the absence of contaminating particulates is highly recommended. Although this method is very useful for purified EVs, this method is not appropriate for use in the setting of highly heterogeneous samples such as for plasma or serum, where extracellular proteins (including lipoproteins and ribonucleoproteins) not associated with EVs would be labelled along with the EV-associated proteins.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1603473831}
