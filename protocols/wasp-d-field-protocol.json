Only heat, time and ambient humidity are required to lower SARS-CoV-2 viral load by six orders of magnitude. Heat also has the advantage of penetrating areas that cannot be reached by vapors or UV light, thus simplifying the decontamination process and reducing operating costs. WASP-D is well suited for low-resource environments and to relieve temporary PPE shortages.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">To avoid damage to PPE materials, temperatures are limited to a  \"warm\" range between 110F-122F (43C-50C), for a decontamination  interval of 12hrs (at 46C\/115F). Above 50C, or in the presence of UV-C, steam or chemical sanitizers, PPE  elasticity or tear strength may be compromised, limiting reuse and possibly affecting its ability to exclude pathogens. See \"Guidelines and Warnings\" for more details.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">At these \"warm\" temperatures, some but not all pathogens will be diminished. Thus an \"index' system where decontaminated PPE are returned to their original wearer is prudent. Never the less, in situations where SARS-CoV-2 is the primary infectious agent, WASP-D can relieve PPE shortages and improve patient and health system outcomes.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1605207530}
