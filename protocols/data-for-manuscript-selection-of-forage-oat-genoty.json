Therefore, it was proposed to select more productive and stable  genotypes through statistical methods of GGE Biplot and BLUP. The  research was conducted in three environments in Bolivia and six  commercial varieties of forage oats were evaluated; three of them  correspond to INIA Peru and the rest of Bolivia. Data were analyzed  through GGE Biplot and BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) and an  average yield of 10.29 \u00b13.51 t ha<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">\u22121<\/span><span> of dry matter was  obtained. BLUP accumulated greater variance than GGE Biplot in the first  two components. In terms of productivity and stability values, both  models have the same selection trend. Thus, Tayco and Texas were  selected for their outstanding characteristic in dry matter yield and  phenotypic stability.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1584471926}
