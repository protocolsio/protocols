Put the Streptomycin in the media and mix. The media will solidify rapidly so be ready to pour it into plates or tubes once out of the water bath. Scar the media surface (under sterlie conditions) when it has solidified to make it more habitable to the beetles. When closed and sterile, the media are usable for for several months.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In the field, after the beetle and the label are added, a critical step is to perforate the vial lid with a pin. Without ventilation, the beetle quickly suffocates. A minute pin hole is sufficient, and when in the middle of the lid, it prevents the beetle from finding it.<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol describes how to safely transport bark and ambrosia beetles. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol is part of the Bark Beetle Mycobiome (BBM) Research Coordination Network.
