Severe hypophosphatemia represents a potentially serious complication since it may be associated with increased rates of heart and respiratory failure and rhabdomyolysis, as well as with chronic manifestations, especially osteomalacia. Nonetheless, it remains unclear which iron preparation is linked to higher rates of hypophosphatemia. As a result, the present network meta-analysis aims to accumulate current literature knowledge in the field in order to simultaneously compare the effects of different intravenous iron preparations (ferric carboxymaltose, ferumoxytol, iron isomaltoside, iron sucrose and iron dextran) on serum phosphate, by taking into account both direct and indiret evidence.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1585422488}
