For biological applications, one of its key advantages is its ability to visualize substructure of single molecules and molecular complexes in an aqueous environment. Here, we describe the application of AFM to determine the secondary and tertiary structure of surface-bound DNA, and it\u2019s interactions with proteins.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Mica and DNA are both negatively charged at a neutral pH in aqueous solution.
