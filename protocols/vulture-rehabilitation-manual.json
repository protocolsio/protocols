class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Every single vulture species is under threat, not only in southern Africa, but across Africa and the globe. The dangers to the species vary by location, with most threats being anthropogenic. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The principle behind this manual is that every vulture\u2019s life counts. Each individual deserves the chance to fly free and reproduce. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This manual is based on 15 years of VulPro\u2019s experience in rehabilitating African vultures. VulPro\u2019s rehabilitation experience is mainly based on the Gyps species, namely the African White-backed and Cape Vulture; but also with Lappet-faced, White-headed, and Palm-nut Vultures. VulPro also rehabilitates large raptors such as owls, eagles, hawks and secretary birds. Vultures, however, are unique in several respects and therefore warrant their own attention with regards to husbandry and medical treatment. This document is designed to advise and aid the rehabilitation of large, Old World vulture species (namely the Gyps, Torgos, and Trigonoceps species) but should also be considered in the treatment of smaller vulture species. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1603098697}
