During the fast, subjects were asked to avoid any alcohol, caffeine, or medication that could affect GI function. The study began with a baseline 3D T2-weighted MRI scan to ensure the subject had a fasted stomach. This was done by checking the resting stomach did not contain any residual food but only the gastric juice, which appeared bright in T2-weighted images. The resting gastric juice was later manually segmented and its volume was calculated for each subject. Then, the subject was given a naturalistic contrast meal consisting of 350g blended natural ingredients that were rich in manganese content (128g firm tofu, 95g pineapple chunks, 57g pineapple juice, 32g blueberry, and 38g banana). The nutrient content of this test meal was as follows: energy (kcal) 236, carbohydrate 74%, protein 13%, fat 7%, and fiber 6%. Immediately after meal, a set of three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted dynamic MRI scans were acquired for about 5 minutes. Each scan consisted of 60-80 coronal image slices covering the entire stomach with an isotropic spatial resolution of 1.9 mm. The sampling interval between MRI volumes was 3.3-4.2s. The same set of scans was repeatedly performed approximately every 10 minutes for 1-hour post-meal. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":51980,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"2","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":1224206,"guid":"94AF7D80F09E11EB8385BB30B6E37BE1","previous_id":1224204,"previous_guid":"4C1E1130F09E11EB8385BB30B6E37BE1","section":"\u003cp\u003eMRI acquisition and analysis\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"8253s\",\"text\":\"The MRI scans were performed using a 3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner with an 18-channel body coil, a 32-channel spine coil, and conventional 3D imaging sequences.
