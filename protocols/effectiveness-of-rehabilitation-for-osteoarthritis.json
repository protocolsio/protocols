The treatment of meniscus injuries consists of conservative therapy and surgery, and the benefit of combining surgery with rehabilitation has become clear. However, the effectiveness of rehabilitation alone, according to the degree of isolated meniscus injury, has not been clarified.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2b9a Eligibility criteria: The review will be a scoping review of the effectiveness of rehabilitation for osteoarthritis of the knee with unilateral or bilateral isolated meniscus injuries in patients over 40 years of age. Outcomes will be pain, function, and re-injury. All types of research will be accepted without restrictions as to location, race, gender, or language of the original article. \u2b9a Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Web of Science, and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) databases using the keywords \"meniscus\" and \"physical therapy\" will be conducted during September 2021. In addition, we will not limit the language of the search, in order to include all studies.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Data extraction tools will be used to specifically show findings in extracted articles related to participants, concepts, context, research design, and review questions. Outcomes should be pain, function, and re-injury, and results should be specified for each outcome.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1632100417}
