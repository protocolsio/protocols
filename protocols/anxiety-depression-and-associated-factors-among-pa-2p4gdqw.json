Objective: To assess magnitude of anxiety, depression and associated factors among patients with epilepsy attending at outpatients of Ayder Referral, Mekelle and Adigrat Hospital, Tigray, Ethiopia, 2018. Methods: An institution based cross - sectional study design using was conducted from May 15 to June 24, 2018. Data were collected by using face to face interview and systematic sampling was used. Depression and anxiety were measured by using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Binary logistic regression was used to see the association between dependent and independent variables. Results: A total of 416 study participants were interviewed with 99.3% response rate and 59.6% of study participants were male. The mean age of the study participants was 33.19 ±13.66 years. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among people with epilepsy was 37.7 % and 39.9 %, respectively. Depression was associated with poor social support (AOR = 3.33), low monthly income (AOR = 2.17), perceived stigma (AOR =5.01), medication non –adherence (AOR =2.06), side effects of AEDs (AOR = 3.71) and current use of alcohol (AOR =2.35). Anxiety was associated with poor social support (AOR = 4.59), perceived stigma (AOR =2.42), medication non –adherence (AOR =2.77), \\u003e= 4 times frequency of seizure attacks per months (AOR = 3.04), and side effects of AEDs (AOR = 4.92). Conclusion: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among people with epilepsy was high. Both depression and anxiety had a statistically significant association with perceived stigma, AEDs side effects, medication non-adherence, and social support. Being lower monthly income and current use of alcohol had a statistically significant association with depression only. A frequency of seizure attacks per months had statistically significant association with anxiety only.\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":14},{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":154,\"length\":10},{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":358,\"length\":7},{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":751,\"length\":8},{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":1523,\"length\":11}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"fcj1j\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ah7qi\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"header-one\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"6eks4\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"e1ge\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"","document":"{\"blocks\":null,\"entityMap\":null}","documents":[{"id":0,"type_id":0,"filename":"","key":"","color":"","height":0,"width":0,"is_document":null,"original_file_id":null,"thumb_url":"https://www.protocols.io/img/extensions/docx.png","size":null,"is_private":0,"is_new":0,"ofn":"Manuscript.docx","url":"https://content.protocols.io/bgt36t3w.docx","bucket_name":null,"s3_webp_url":"","file_id":"39481"}],"doi":"dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.2p4gdqw","doi_status":2,"ethics_statement":null,"fork_id":null,"fork_info":null,"forks":[],"funders":[],"groups":[],"guid":"870B5F16B9DA11E99CA40242AC110005","guidelines":"","has_references":false,"has_step_reagents":false,"has_versions":false,"id":23004,"image":{"source":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_document.png","webp_source":null,"placeholder":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_document.png","webp_placeholder":null},"image_attribution":"","in_trash":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_contact_suspended":false,"is_content_confidential":false,"is_content_warning":false,"is_doi_reserved":false,"is_in_pending_publishing":false,"is_in_transfer":false,"is_owner":true,"is_research":true,"is_retracted":false,"is_shared_directly":false,"is_subprotocol":null,"is_unlisted":false,"item_id":450275,"journal":null,"journals":[],"keywords":"   Anxiety, Depression, Epilepsy","last_modified":1689272925,"link":"","location":null,"manuscript_citation":"\u003cp\u003eGessessew Teklebrhan Gebrehiwot1, Bizuneh Tesfaye Molla2, Asrat Chaka Gizaw3, Yodit Habtamu Bezabh4\u003c/p\u003e","materials":[],"materials_text":"","ownership_history":null,"parent_collections":[],"parent_protocols":[],"peer_reviewed":false,"protocol_references":"","public":true,"public_fork_note":"","published_on":1689272925,"references":[],"related_equipments":[],"related_materials":[],"reserved_doi":"","retraction_reason":null,"samples":{},"shared_access_id":0,"show_comparison":false,"sign_info":null,"state_version_id":0,"stats":{"is_voted":false,"number_of_views":24,"number_of_steps":1,"number_of_bookmarks":0,"number_of_comments":0,"number_of_bookmarked_comments":0,"number_of_steps_comments":0,"number_of_protocol_comments":0,"number_of_exports":0,"number_of_runs":0,"number_of_votes":0,"number_of_reagents":0,"number_of_equipments":0,"number_of_collections":0,"number_of_forks":{"private":0,"public":0},"number_of_accessible_forks":0},"status":{"id":1,"info":"We use this document and it's working"},"steps":[{"id":739245,"guid":"CDF37B70719611E994906F82D1323593","previous_id":0,"previous_guid":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"","data":null,"protocol_id":23004,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"1","cases":[],"critical":null}],"template_id":3,"title":"Anxiety, depression and associated factors among patients with epilepsy attending at outpatients of Ayder Referral, Mekelle and Adigrat Hospitals, Tigray, Ethiopia: A cross -
