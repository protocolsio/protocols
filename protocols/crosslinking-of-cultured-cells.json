The enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) methodology provides a framework for robust, reproducible identification of transcriptome-wide protein-RNA interactions, with dramatically improved efficiency over previous methods. Here we provide a step-by-step description of the eCLIP method, along with insights into optimal performance of critical steps in the protocol. In particular, we describe improvements to the adaptor strategy that enables single-end enhanced CLIP (seCLIP), which removes the requirement for paired-end sequencing of eCLIP libraries. Further, we describe the observation of contaminating RNA present in standard nitrocellulose membrane suppliers, and present options with significantly reduced contamination for sensitive applications. These notes further refine the eCLIP methodology, simplifying robust RNA binding protein studies for all users.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617646}
