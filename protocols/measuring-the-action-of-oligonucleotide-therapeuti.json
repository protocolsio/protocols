Moreover, this can be reliably achieved with up to 66% fewer animals than standard in vivo pharmacology approaches due to lower data variance afforded through analytics on defined, viable cell numbers. Here we describe the TDCS methodology for the isolation of total lung epithelia, lung macrophages, and epithelium\/macrophage-depleted cell fractions from mouse lungs using a two-stage sorting process of immunomagnetic bead separation followed by flow cytometric sorting using fluorescent antibodies against well-established surface markers such as F4\/80, CD11b, and CD326. Validated antibodies for additional cell types and markers are also provided.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617667}
