When an invading virus enters bacterial cells, the bacteria retain pieces of the virus\u2019s DNA to create CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) segments. This process is similar to antibody production in which it helps the host cell with viral recognition. If a viral invasion were to reoccur, the bacteria would be able to produce RNA from the CRISPR segment to target the virus\u2019 DNA. The CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is connected by a nucleotide linker to the trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA). The tracrRNA is the link between the Cas9 protein and the crRNA. When the crRNA finds a complementary DNA strand, Cas9 cleaves the region of the viral DNA. This mechanism allows for bacteria to disrupt the DNA of invading viruses. The CRISPR\/Cas9 complex has been applied to genetic engineering due to this ability to splice DNA in a specified region. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">A double-stranded DNA splice caused by CRISPR can be repaired via two mechanisms: nonhomologous recombination repair (NHEJ) or homologous recombination repair (HRR). When NHEJ occurs, the overhanging DNA pieces are joined together by DNA ligase IV and any remaining spaces are filled in. This can induce a knockout DNA product and\/ or cause a mutation. Alternatively, HRR is the process in which the damaged DNA uses a homologous template from undamaged DNA. We will be using this same principle to knock in a gene by providing a template strand containing regions homologous to both sides of the double-stranded splice as well as the insert of the desired nucleotide between.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In this experiment, the goal is to genetically engineer E Coli to survive on streptomycin. To do so, we are targeting the rpsL gene which produces the small ribosomal subunit. Typically streptomycin binds to the rpsL gene and prevents protein formation,  killing the bacteria. However, this edit prevents streptomycin from binding and inhibiting protein production. In other words, it becomes resistant to streptomycin. The template contains a mutation of the lysine amino acid, changing AAA to ACA. The mutation of the adenine to cytosine results in the codon change to a threonine. You will prepare the E coli for uptake of the provided template, let Cas-9 do its thing, and then test the E coli's survival on an agar plate containing streptomycin. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Resources<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Read:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medlineplus.gov\/genetics\/understanding\/genomicresearch\/genomeediting\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">CRISPR\/Cas9: what is gene editing<\/span><\/a><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\"> <\/span><span>(NIH article) <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1p36d2EGIeUUI0xMfrGBZzdN8VP9Tt74Y\/edit?pli=1\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">The ODIN protocols to CRISPR\/Cas9<\/span><\/a><span>(ODIN document protocol) (refer to pages 2-5, 10-11, 14-15, 20)<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Extra:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3748948\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Papers supporting mutation effect<\/span><\/a><span> (how the CRISPR edit makes the E coli antibiotic-resistant)<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uniprot.org\/uniprot\/P0A7S3\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">info on rpsL<\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/sweN8d4_MUg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7pOR3ssg7dg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3AQWMG2Lqvc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Disclaimer:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">The information provided on this document is intended for the educational purposes of the BME 22L laboratory course.
