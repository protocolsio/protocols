Tai Chi has shown promise as a non-pharmacological therapy in improving sleep quality in insomnia patients, but the underlying brain network mechanisms remain unclear. This study utilized advanced multimodal brain function analysis techniques, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to investigate how Tai Chi affects brain networks in individuals with insomnia. The research aims to assess the therapeutic effects of Tai Chi in different intervention cycles and to explore the potential for Tai Chi to become the preferred non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"b7tji\",\"text\":\"Methods: This study is designed as a parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) involving 36 participants.

The primary outcomes will be LC resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI); Hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) will be measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The secondary outcomes will be pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), insomnia severity index (ISI), and hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA).

A band-pass filter operating between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz was used to remove high-frequency noise from the raw data. Following band-pass filtering, a threshold of 30 dB was used to locate the noise in the detection channel and eliminate slowly drifting noise from the body and environment.31 Motion artifacts were then removed using a processing technique based on moving standard deviations and cubic spline interpolation.32 The sliding window's standard deviation over a predetermined threshold was used to locate artifacts. After that, cubic spline interpolation was used to eliminate them. Based on the filtered optical data, HbO and HbR concentrations were calculated using an improved version of the beer Lambert Law.33 As the baseline, we took the last ten seconds of the pre-task break. Each channel contains the average HbO and HbR levels for each participant during the task period and at baseline. By deducting the baseline mean HbO and HbR value from the task period mean HbO and\\nHbR value, HbO and HbR value during the task was calculated. Through this, we were able to determine the mean difference between the baseline and task periods for HbO and HbR.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":393,\"length\":2},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":527,\"length\":2},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":827,\"length\":2}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":101751,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"8.2","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":2119636,"guid":"B3E7BB2C876D44D0A887C575C0829C84","previous_id":2119629,"previous_guid":"E074D30D19F840CFBA8EDDBFACC7EDC9","section":"\u003cp\u003eMethods\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"is_substep":true,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"8hg3n\",\"text\":\"Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) feature extraction of locus coeruleus (LC) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"7c33d\",\"text\":\"The brain regions with abnormal rs-FC were obtained through the analysis of the LC and other voxels, and rs-fMRI will be collected from the following brain regions under different interventions: right precuneus, right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left calcarine cortex, and right superior orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).22 Then, based on seed analysis, the changes of abnormal rs-FC signals between LC and various brain areas under different interventions were compared to compare the correlation between improved rs-FC values and clinical scale scores.\\nFMRI data acquisition\\nThe FMRI scan will be completed on a 3.0 T whole-body MRI scanner (MAGNETOM-Skyra-SIEMENS) with a volume transmit head coil and 32-channel receive coil. The MRI sequences included the following: (1) T1-weighted MRI: data were acquired using a magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo sequence with TR/TE at 700 ms/11 ms, FOV at 256 × 256 × 192, and a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 0.9; (2) rs-fMRI: data were acquired using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to BOLD with TR/TE/FA at 2020 ms/30 ms/90°, and FOV at 106 × 106 × 46, and a voxel size of 2.4 × 2.4 × 3.75.

Subsequently, the rs-fMRI data will be regulated for the existence of temporal differences between slice timing and realignment. All participants will have a maximum displacement of no more than 2.0 mm in any direction and a maximum rotation of no more than 2.0. The fMRI data will be spatially normalized according to a standard template (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI) and re-sampled to 3 mm3. Spatial smoothing will be carried out using a 4-mm half-maximum full-width Gaussian kernel, removing the linear trend, and will be filtered with a 0.01-0.1 Hz bandwidth for filtering.
