The reaction mixture consisted of 1.0 ml of extract, 0.3 ml of 5% sodium nitrite and 4 ml of 60% ethanol. After 6 min, 0.3 ml of 10% aluminium nitrite was added. In the next 6 minutes, 4 ml of 1 M sodium hydroxide solution were added. Then, the volumetric tube was diluted to 10 ml. The absorbance was measured at 510 nm.TFC was calculated and expressed as rutin equivalents (RE). A calibration curve was constructed with different concentrations of rutin (15\u201375 mg\/ml)as a standard.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1583473712}
