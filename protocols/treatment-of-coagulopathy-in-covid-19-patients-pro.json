The treatment of COVID-19 and the control of coagulopathy are the primary concern. Although the evidence of anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy is compiling, there is no scoping review to systematically map the anticoagulants used in this area and to identify the existing gaps between investigated treatment and not. The objective is to conduct a scoping review of available evidence on the anticoagulants in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Methods <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">For conducting the scoping review protocol, we will use a scoping review methodology in the Joanna Briggs Institute manual. This methodology has a five-stage approach: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(1) identify the research question; (2) identify relevant studies; (3) select studies; (4) chart the data and (5) collating, summarize and report the results. We also will use the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews to assess the results. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Ethics and dissemination<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Because this is a review of the literature, ethics approval is not indicated. We will disseminate the findings from this review in publications in peer-reviewed journals. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1590121701}
