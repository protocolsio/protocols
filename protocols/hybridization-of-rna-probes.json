Although RNA sequencing methods provide unsurpassed insights into ncRNA distribution and expression, detailed information on structure and processing are harder to extract from sequence data. In contrast, northern blotting methods provide uniquely detailed insights into complex RNA populations but are rarely employed outside specialist RNA research groups. Such techniques are generally considered difficult for nonspecialists, which is unfortunate as substantial technical advances in the past few decades have solved the major challenges. Here we present simple, reproducible and highly robust protocols for separating glyoxylated RNA on agarose gels and heat denatured RNA on polyacrylamide\u2013urea gels using standard laboratory electrophoresis equipment. We also provide reliable transfer and hybridization protocols that do not require optimization for most applications. Together, these should allow any molecular biology lab to elucidate the structure and processing of ncRNAs of interest.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Introduction<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Northern blotting methods allow for simultaneous quantification and molecular weight determination of RNA. Although superseded by qPCR and sequencing methods for routine mRNA quantification, northern blotting is the method of choice when complex mixtures of overlapping species are under investigation. This is particularly true when studying RNA processing by complexes such as the exosome, and generally aids in resolving the behavior of differentially expressed RNA isoforms. Historically, northern analysis has been something of a black art; running a high-quality formaldehyde gel required substantial skill and a little luck, while radioactive probing of RNA membranes often resulted in terrible cross-hybridization and invisible signals. Fortunately, technology has moved on such that modern northern analysis methods are simple and robust.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Electrophoretic separation of single-stranded RNA is more complex than double-stranded DNA as RNA forms strong secondary structures that impede separation by molecular weight in a gel matrix. For analysis of high molecular weight RNA in agarose gels, chemical modification of guanine is the preferred method to melt secondary structure, which disrupts C:G base pairing and allows single stranded RNA to migrate according to size. Although formaldehyde has been widely used for this purpose [<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007\/978-1-4939-9822-7_5#CR1\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">1<\/span><\/a><span>], it is not ideal due to issues with sample migration and batch-to-batch variation. Furthermore formaldehyde gels release toxic formaldehyde gas; this did not overly concern early investigators eager to replace the hideously toxic denaturant methyl mercury used in the first northern blotting protocols [<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007\/978-1-4939-9822-7_5#CR2\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">2<\/span><\/a><span style = \":;:;:UNDERLINE;:UNDERLINE;\">,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/protocol\/10.1007\/978-1-4939-9822-7_5#CR3\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">3<\/span><\/a><span>], but is clearly a problem in modern labs.
