In addition to evaluating the effect of afferent versus efferent VNS on gastric motility, we further applied bi-directional VNS (i.e. combined afferent and efferent VNS) to the rats in the afferent VNS group, immediately after which afferent VNS was performed.

The frequency of afferent or efferent VNS was defined as the number of electrical pulses delivered per second. The frequency of bidirectional VNS was defined as the number of paired cathodal and anodal pulses delivered per second. Low, medium and high values were selected for each parameter settings, all of which are frequently used in clinical and preclinical settings. Each stimulation setting comprised of a duty cycle of 1-minute ON and 1-minute OFF, and different VNS settings were performed in a randomized order to eliminate any causal effect of one setting on the other.

Following a toe-pinch test, a \u223c3\u202fcm incision was made starting at 1\u202fcm  caudal to the xiphoid and moving 3\u202fcm caudally.

Low, medium and high values were selected for each parameter settings, all of which are frequently used in clinical and preclinical settings. Each stimulation setting comprised of a duty cycle of 20s ON and 40s OFF, and different GES settings were performed in a randomized order to eliminate any causal effect of one setting on the other.
