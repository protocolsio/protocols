MONITORING, AUDIT & INSPECTION<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits and inspections by the Sponsor as required. This study will not be routinely monitored by the Sponsor, in accordance to the low risk nature of the study, but may be subject to audit for the QA team within the R&D department. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.

Assessment and Management of Risk<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">As part of the Sponsor\u2019s review process for all research projects, the study has been risk assessed according to their SOP. This study has been assessed as low risk. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.2. Peer review<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The study protocol was peer reviewed by Prof. Maarten Taal, co-investigator of the study.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.3.

Research Ethics Committee (REC) & Regulatory Considerations<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The study will be conducted in compliance with the approved protocol and the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and all related documentation (e.g. informed consent form, participant information sheet, questionnaires) have been reviewed and received approval by a Research Ethics Committee (REC). The investigator will not begin any participant activities until approval from the HRA and REC has been obtained and documented. All documentation and correspondence must be retained in the trial master file\/investigator site file. Substantial amendments that require HRA and REC (where applicable) review will not be implemented until the HRA and REC grants a favourable opinion (with the exception of those necessary to reduce immediate risk to participants).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">It is the responsibility of the CI to ensure that an annual progress report (APR) is submitted to the REC within 30 days of the anniversary date on which the favourable opinion was given, annually until the study is declared ended. The CI is also responsible for notifying the REC of the end of study (see Section 6.9) within 90 days. Within one year of the end of study, the CI will submit a final report with the results, including any publications\/abstracts to the REC.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Before any site can enroll a patient into the study confirmation of capacity must be sought from the site\u2019s research and development (R&D) department. In addition for any amendment that will potentially affect the site\u2019s permission, the research team must confirm with the site\u2019s R&D department that permission is ongoing (Section 11.10).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.5. Protocol Compliance \/ Non-compliance Reporting<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures described in this protocol. Prospective, planned deviations and\/or waivers to the protocol are not acceptable, however accidental protocol deviations (non-compliances) may happen and as such these must be recorded. Non-compliances should be recorded in the CRF and\/or a non-compliance log kept in the ISF.All non-compliances should be reviewed and assessed by the PI (or appropriately delegated individual) to determine if they meet the criteria of a \u201cserious breach\u201d (Section 12.6). Non-compliances which are found to frequently recur are not acceptable, will require immediate action, and could potentially be classified as a serious breach.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.6. Notification of Serious Breaches to GCP and\/or the Protocol<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">A \u201cserious breach\u201d is a departure from the protocol, Sponsor procedures (i.e. SOPs), or regulatory requirements which is likely to effect to a significant degree \u2013<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(a)The safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study; or<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(b)The scientific value of the study.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">If the PI (or delegate) is unsure if a non-compliance meets these criteria, they should consult the Sponsor for further guidance. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">If a serious breach is identified the investigator should notify the Sponsor immediately (i.e. within 1 working day) using the \u2018Non-CTIMP Notification of a Serious Breach\u2019 form. The report will be reviewed by the Sponsor and CI, and where appropriate, the Sponsor will notify the REC within 7 calendar days of being made aware of the breach. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.7. Data Protection and Patient Confidentiality<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The study will be conducted in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018. The investigator will ensure that participant\u2019s anonymity is maintained throughout the study and following completion of the study. Once the final dataset has been created the data will be pseudo-anonymised, with each patient given a study ID with no patient identifiable data<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">All documents will be stored securely with access restricted to study staff and authorised personnel. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Nitin V Kolhe will act as the custodian of the data generated in the study.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.8.

Indemnity<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">As UHDB is acting as the research Sponsor for this study, NHS indemnity applies. NHS indemnity provides cover for legal liabilities where the NHS has a duty of care. Non-negligent harm is not covered by the NHS indemnity scheme. UHDB, therefore, cannot agree in advance to pay compensation in these circumstances. In exceptional circumstances an ex-gratia payment may be offered.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">11.10. Amendments<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">If changes to the study are required these must be discussed with the Sponsor, who is responsible for deciding if an amendment is required and if it should be deemed substantial or non-substantial. Substantial amendments will be submitted to the relevant regulatory bodies (REC, HRA) for review and approval. The amendments will only be implemented after approval and a favourable opinion has been obtained. Non-substantial amendments will be submitted to the HRA for their approval\/ acknowledgment.
