You can directly paste into R studio and run, choosing the effect matrix you want.  Third note is some results of the power analyses with 000's of loops.  Use 1000 loops to have a quick look at the output; go up to 1x10^5 loops for accuracy (takes a while to finish).  Entering zeros into the effect matrix give power of 0.05 (except for the age effect, which is defined by 'slope'), which shows the anlysis works correctly.  <\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>We used <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Power analyses<\/span><span> to clarify our ability to detect the effects of stressors as main effects, or as interactions, with these sample sizes.

We constructed a linear model with chronological age as a covariate with a normal distribution and a relationship to the response variable with a slope of 0.9. We then added sex and both food and drug treatments (full model: response = age + food*drug*sex) to ask if treatment effects could be detected at the p<0.05 threshold in at least 80% of the cases during 1x105 iterations (80% is a standard threshold in power analyses<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zotero.org\/google-docs\/?hj8uuJ\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">55<\/span><\/a><span>). From this, we are confident we will have the power to detect main effects within a single season. For example, where food supplementation drives an increase in the response across both sexes or across both drug and control individuals, power was >0.9, i.e there is a 90% probability of finding a significant effect. If, however, food drove the expected response in only one sex or only in drug treated individuals, our power to detect this interaction was ~0.56, below the required power threshold. Our power to detect interaction effects rises to >0.8 when the larger sample size of both field seasons are incorporated. We also observed in ref<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.zotero.org\/google-docs\/?02fme2\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">12<\/span><\/a><span> that \u2018grid\u2019 effects average ~0.5SD, and so performed further analysis with six \u2018grids\u2019, where treatments were nested within \u2018grid\u2019 for the statistical model. This analysis confirmed that the proposed sample size for one field season allows for the detection of main effects, but power to detect interaction effects requires both field seasons. <\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1624454498}
