Although it has potential for development, the use of emotional and motivational factors in adolescent smoking prevention is still limited. Moreover, this study was designed specifically in the context of the classroom setting, where adolescents generally spend most of their time. Two types of questionnaires were used as instruments to collect data in the two studies. The first one was used in Study I to collect information about students' opinions on cigarettes and smoking activities. The second type was used in Study II to examine the effect of emotional and motivational factors on peer support. For study replication needs, we provide a study protocol. This protocol describes a process starting from study preparation to data collection. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ale6c\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1cul6\",\"text\":\"The current study was focused on students located in Palembang, the capital of South Sumatra Province, Indonesia.

The participant was recruited from public and nonpublic high schools where the study is located. Before the study was carried out, we contacted several high schools in Palembang to ask for their availability.

The data collection process also involved the homeroom teacher, who helped distribute the online questionnaire link. Participants received a Google form link from their homeroom teacher and filled out the questionnaire online. Participants completed the questionnaire survey in about 10â€“15 min. Informed consent was obtained from all participants in this study, which was embedded at the beginning of the questionnaire.
