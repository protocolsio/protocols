Study Participation and Patient Registration\/Allocation Procedures<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Written consent was obtained from patients who satisfied all criteria. Patients who gave consent were enrolled in the study. An identification code was assigned to each registered patient for linkable anonymization. A table was created for the chart number of each patient, which was assigned another number. Thus, patient information was managed in a format that does not allow patient identification. Informed consent forms are stored strictly in a locker.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">7.
