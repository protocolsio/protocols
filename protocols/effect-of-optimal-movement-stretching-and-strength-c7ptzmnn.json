Researchers used a Single blinded (assessor), Randomized control trial study (CTRI/2020/04/025628) design. Based on eligibility criteria, 80 participants were recruited from the inpatient SCI unit, CRP-Bangladesh, by hospital randomization technique. After that participants were allocated into an experimental group and a control group (40 vs 40) by computer generated randomization table. Primary outcome measurement was pain during functional activities by Wheelchair User’s Shoulder Pain Index (WUSPI) and secondarily muscle strength by Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) and demographic and injury-related information. Pre-test data were taken 1 week after using the wheelchair and post-test data after 8 weeks (6 sessions/ week) of treatment.
