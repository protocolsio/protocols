In the first screening step, two independent reviewers will review all of the titles and abstracts to exclude irrelevant articles. In the second screening step, two independent reviewers will review all of the full texts to exclude irrelevant articles. Outcomes will be focused on pain, physical function, and quality of life. Chapters will be divided for each outcome and the results will be described.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1620612711}
