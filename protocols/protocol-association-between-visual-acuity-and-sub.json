The reasons for this are not fully understood <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">3<\/span><span>. Possible explanations include: that visual acuity impairment contributes to causing psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">4<\/span><span>; that the same neuropathological processes underlie both visual acuity impairment and psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">5<\/span><span>; that there is poorer access to eye care for people with psychotic illnesses <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>; or that confounding variables create an apparent association.It has been hypothesised that both perfect vision and complete congenital blindness could protect against schizophrenia in the \u2018Protection Against Schizophrenia\u2019 model <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">4, 6<\/span><span>. A longitudinal association between reduced visual acuity and subsequent hospitalisation due to schizophrenia has been robustly demonstrated in a sample of over 1 million men <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">7<\/span><span>, whilst a similarly large 2009 study found the reverse association <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">8<\/span><span>.

Children wore their glasses unless they had not used the glasses for 6 months or more. Testing was performed monocularly only, using patches to occlude one eye. For children who did not know the alphabet, carers supported with matching cards. Children were encouraged to guess when unsure. The test was repeated using a pinhole. Best visual acuity was defined as whichever was the better measurement, with or without the pinhole. Children were moved to 0.5, 1, or 2 metres away from the chart if needed to allow them to read some of the letters. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will use the best eye LogMAR score as a continuous exposure variable, with the unit change being 0.1 on the LogMAR scale. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Although a small number of children had visual acuity measured using Cardiff cards due to inability to cooperate with testing using the standard chart, we will not combine these results with the others due to evidence that they may not be fully compatible <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">10<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Wearing glasses<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">During the visual assessment, carers were also asked whether children wore glasses. We analysed this as a binary exposure variable (yes \/ no).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Visual Acuity Impairment Category<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will also test visual acuity impairment as a categorical variable with four categories: normal vision (LogMAR <\/= 0) without glasses; normal vision with glasses; visual acuity impairment (LogMAR > 0) without glasses; or visual impairment with glasses.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Between-Eye Visual Acuity Difference<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Lastly, we will between-eye visual acuity difference as a continuous exposure variable.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Outcome Variables<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Psychotic-Like Experiences<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Psychotic-Like Experiences Interview (PLIKSi): The PLIKSi is a semi-structured interview designed to elicit psychotic symptoms in the general population. It includes core questions designed to detect positive symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, and thought interference). Each item is rated as \u201csuspected\u201d or definite by interviewers, and symptoms occurring only in the context of partial sleep states or fever are excluded <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">11<\/span><span>. The PLIKSi was administered to participants at ages 13, 17, and 24, and has been validated in ALSPAC data <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">11<\/span><span>. The primary outcome measure will be suspected or definite symptoms suspected on PLIKSi at age 24 or age 17.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Confounding Variables<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The following variables have been measured in the ALSPAC dataset and will be considered a priori as putative confounders:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Basic Minimal Adjustment<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>1)Birth sex of child (male \/ female): there is some evidence that male gender might increase risk of psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">12<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>2)Ethnicity of mother and mother\u2019s partner: people who are in an ethnic minority in their country of residence are also known to be at higher risk <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">13<\/span><span><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>3)Categorical socioeconomic group of mother and mother\u2019s partner: being in a in lower socioeconomic group may increase the risk of psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">13<\/span><span> and lessen opportunity to access opticians.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Others<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>4)Age of mother and mother\u2019s partner in pregnancy and mother\u2019s partner\u2019s age in pregnancy as categorical variables: There is evidence that older paternal age is associated with schizophrenia, and maternal age is well-known to be associated with risk of chromosomal abnormalities which can increase risk of eyesight problems and mental illness <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">14<\/span><span>. Parental age <20 has also been associated with psychotic illness in offspring, which is why this variable will not be included as a continuous variable<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">14<\/span><span>. Categories will be <20, 21-29, 30-34, and 35+.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>5)Requirement for resuscitation at birth: This is a marker of birth hypoxia. There is clear evidence that birth hypoxia can cause both visual impairment and psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">15, 16<\/span><span>. We will assess this as a dichotomous variable, i.e. resuscitation at birth or no resuscitation at birth, as it is expected that the need for resuscitation rather than the method used will be the confounder<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>6)IQ: Intellectual disability is a risk factor for psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">17<\/span><span> as well as being associated with visual impairment <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">18<\/span><span>. IQ aged 8 will be analysed as a continuous variable.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>7)Higher educational level is known to predispose to myopia <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">19<\/span><span>, and might also be a protective factor against psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">12<\/span><span>, so could plausibly lead to negative confounding of the relationship between visual impairment and psychosis.Parental educational level will used as a proxy as this has been measured before the exposure, unlike participant educational level. This will be a categorical variable.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>8)Hearing impairment: Hearing impairment co-occurs with visual impairment in certain genetic conditions and birth complications <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">20<\/span><span>. It is also a risk factor for psychosis, and therefore may confound the association <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">21<\/span><span>. Presence of significant hearing impairment at age 7 will be analysed as a binary variable (normal hearing vs any impairment).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>9)Standardised Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder will be tested <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">22<\/span><span>; to mitigate against the possibility that an association between myopia and psychosis is purely due to shared genetic vulnerability. These will be a continuous variables.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>10)Parity: There is evidence that higher parity increases risk of psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">14<\/span><span> but being first-born increases risk of myopia <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">23<\/span><span>, leading to a possibility of negative confounding by birth order. This will be included as a continuous variable.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>11)Mother\u2019s daily vitamin D intake in pregnancy: vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with both myopia and schizophrenia <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">24, 25<\/span><span>. This will be included as a continuous variable.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>12)Maternal diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension reported during pregnancy: there has been some evidence linking diabetes in pregnancy with hallucinatory experiences in offspring<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;font-style:italic;\">26<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">, <\/span><span>and in mouse models diabetes disrupts ocular development <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">27<\/span><span>. Similarly maternal hypertension is a risk factor for psychosis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">14<\/span><span> and myopia <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">23<\/span><span>. These will be assessed as binary variables (present \/ absent).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>13)Infection during pregnancy: there is evidence that in-utero exposure to infection can increase the risk of both psychosis and ocular pathology <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">28, 2930<\/span><span>. Again, this will be assessed as a binary variable (present \/ absent).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>14)Mother used alcohol in 1-3 months of pregnancy , maternal smoking in first 3 months of pregnancy, and maternal use of recreational drugs in pregnancy: There is evidence that maternal use of alcohol and tobacco during pregnancy increases the risk of psychosis and ocular pathology in offspring<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">3132<\/span><span>, and recreational drug use has been linked with ocular and cerebral changes <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">33<\/span><span>. Alcohol use will be a categorical variable: none; < 1 glass per week; or > 1 glass per week, due to low numbers in higher categories and limited evidence that drinking < 1 unit per week in pregnancy is harmful <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">34<\/span><span>. Tobacco use will be a binary variable (yes \/ no). Drug use will also be binary; reported use of any recreational drug vs none.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">15)Parental history of depression: these variables will be dichotomised as present \/ absent.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">16)Parental history of sight problems at time of pregnancy<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The above putative confounding variables will be included in final models if there is evidence of attenuation of the effect size. Variables will not be included as confounders if their introduction leads to significant problems with sparsity or missing data. Where this is a problem, we will consider testing the association in the subset who do have this information available as a sensitivity analysis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Sensitivity Analysis<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">As a sensitivity analysis, we will also explore different components of the PLIKSi individually.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Statistical Test<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>We will use the statistical package STATA version 16 <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">35<\/span><span> to analyse the results. We will use univariable (unadjusted) and multivariable (adjusted) multilevel logistic regression models to assess for an association between these variables. Odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values will be reported. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Missing Data<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>If there is evidence that data is missing at random then we will use multiple imputation to assess and report on the likely effects of the missing data <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">36<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Anticipated Strengths and Limitations<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Strengths of the proposed study include use of one of the largest, most detailed birth cohorts available to seek longitudinal evidence of an association between visual impairment and psychosis beginning in childhood <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">9<\/span><span>. To our knowledge this would be the first study to test an association using a childhood exposure of this type, and the first longitudinal study to test this association including female participants.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Limitations include the potential for attrition bias. There is likely to be a significant amount of missing data given that ALSPAC is a longitudinal cohort study. Previous studies have found that only half of the cohort had complete data necessary for analysis <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">37<\/span><span>. It is plausible that people who develop psychotic illnesses are less likely to remain in the study, which might lead to weakening of any genuine association. Missing data may introduce similar bias into the results, though the planned use of multiple imputation aims to address this. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>A further limitation is the inability to link ALSPAC to hospital records in this study. The PLIKSi is designed to measure psychotic-like experiences, rather than psychotic illnesses, which are of greater clinical relevance. In keeping with this the PLIKSi has shown poor correlation with polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia, showing that psychotic-like experiences do not entirely overlap with propensity to develop psychotic illness <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">38<\/span><span>. The use of self-reported schizophrenia diagnosis as a secondary outcome measure is intended to strengthen validity of findings. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Residual and unmeasured confounding remains a possibility given that the exposure in this study cannot be allocated at random.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Acknowledgements<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This work has been funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR300703).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.<\/span><span>Moreno C, Nuevo R, Chatterji S, Verdes E, Arango C, Ayuso-Mateos JL.
