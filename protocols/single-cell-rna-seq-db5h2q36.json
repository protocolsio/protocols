Briefly, 10× beads were subjected to second-strand cDNA synthesis, adaptor ligation, and universal amplification. Sequencing libraries were prepared using randomly interrupted whole-transcriptome amplification products to enrich the 3’ end of the transcripts linked with the cell barcode and UMI.

FASTQs generated from Illumina sequencing output were aligned to the mouse genome, version GRCm38, using the STAR algorithm. Next, gene-barcode matrices were generated for each individual sample by counting UMIs and filtering non-cell-associated barcodes. Finally, we generated a gene-barcode matrix containing the barcoded cells and gene expression counts. This output was then imported into the Seurat (v2.3.0) R toolkit for quality control and downstream analysis of our single-cell RNA-seq data. All functions were run with default parameters unless specified otherwise. We excluded cells with fewer than 200 or more than 6000 detected genes (where each gene had to have at least one UMI aligned in at least three cells). The expression of mitochondrial genes was calculated using the PercentageFeatureSet function of the Seurat package. To remove low-activity cells, cells with more than 10% expression of mitochondrial genes were excluded. The normalized data (normalizeData function in the Seurat package) were used to extract a subset of variable genes. Variable genes were identified while controlling for the strong relationship between variability and average expression. Next, we integrated data from different samples after identifying ‘anchors’ between datasets using FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData in the seurat package.
