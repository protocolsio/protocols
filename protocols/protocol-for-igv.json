is an interactive tool that allows one to visually analyze genomic data. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing and array-based profiling, there has come a need to analyze these diverse data-sets. IGV is a tool that allows us to analyze genomic information in real-time with great resolution and detail, allowing you to adjust the view from the entire genome down to individual base pairs. IGV is also useful because it gives you the ability to view, group, and filter different types of data sets simultaneously. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">IGV first began development in 2007 in response to the need for The Cancer Genome Atlas project, where they were in demand of a tool to visualize integrated copy number data, expression, mutation, and clinical data. When trying to analyze this data, they realized the vast size of the data sets was a challenge. IGV addresses this by indexing the data files where they allow you to view several hundred samples <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eZUI6lcIX3I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Features<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/8aaba624df7464c742c5c0e7d60990a94d4263fe61c949f90f55925f007d29f9\/cmdcbfc3p.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Reference Genome:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In order to view the data in IGV, it is necessary that you upload a reference genome first. There are several pre-loaded reference genomes that IGV allows you to select from. You also have the ability to upload your own genome by uploading a FASTA file. When the viewer zoom is adjusted sufficiently enough, one can view the reference genome as a separate track. You can also see the individual nucleotides as colored bars or their letters depending on the zoom level. On further adjusting, one can even see the three letter translation of amino acids.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Loading Data:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">IGV has been designed to accept data that can be mapped to genomic coordinates. It can accept over 30 different file formats, namely the formats that support genome annotations, sequence alignments, variant calls, and microarray data.  There are 4 ways that data files can be loaded into IGV. These are:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Using the built-in file browser to select a file on the local file system.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Entering the URL of a file accessible over a network via HTTP or FTP.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Entering the URL of a Distributed Annotation System (DAS) feature source<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Selecting entries from the \u2018File\u2009>\u2009Load from Server\u2019 menu.<\/li><\/ol><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Viewing Data:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">IGV gives users the ability to view multiple data sets simultaneously, using the same or different types of data. For NGS data, it is very useful for analyzing sequence alignments as it is good at taking SAM, BAM, and Goby files. Due to the magnitude of the data stored in these reads, IGV varies the level of detail of the reads based on the zoom settings. There is a user-settable visibility threshold (default 30kb) that once the user passes that threshold, the individual reads will become visible as horizontal bars. Zooming further than this will reveal the individual bases. IGV also uses color and transparency to highlight important events. For instance, some of the gray tracks will be colored to indicate that there are mismatches within the alignment, which is helpful when identifying SNPs. The size and the color of these bars indicate the allele frequencies at these locations. Reads that match the reference genome will match the color of the reference genome tracks.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Instructions<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">We<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/genome.ucsc.edu\/cgi-bin\/hgTracks?db=wuhCor1&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=NC_045512v2%3A1%2D29903&hgsid=907267029_3Q6qe5CgBRhTGuKb4w37lxHZsBu9\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">have provided you with Sars-CoV 2 sequencing data that was acquired using the nanopore.
