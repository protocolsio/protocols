It has been conceived that priming reverse transcription reactions with gene specific primers generates cDNA only from the specific RNA. However, several reports have revealed that cDNA gets synthesized even without addition of exogenous primers in RT reactions. Due to such self-priming activity, the signals from specific strands cannot be accurately detected and can confound the expression analysis, especially in context of overlapping bidirectional transcripts. The protocol described here was used for purification of biotin-tagged cDNA in conjunction with alkaline denaturation. This obviated the problem of background priming and enabled accurate strand specific detection of overlapping transcripts. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1587523789}
