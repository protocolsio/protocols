Lift the remaining bone flap with a pair of fine forceps while cortex buffer is covering the surface. Cortex buffer is key to removal of bone flap without bleeding of the dura since any dried area on the bone would stick to the brain, thereby making a clean removal unlikely. Cortex buffer also helps to soften the bone edge for an easy lift up. Apply Gelfoam that has been soaked in cortex buffer to the dura surface to control small bleeders.
