The article addresses, solely,  the linear response regime in which the polymer brush bilayers behave  very much similar to the Newtonian fluids. My approach to this  long-standing problem split drastically from the work already published <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Kreer, T<\/span><span>,  Soft Matter, 12, 3479 (2016). It has been thought for many decades that  the interpenetration between the brushes is source of the friction  between the brush covered surfaces sliding over each other. Whiles, the  present article strongly rejects the idea of interpenetration length in  that issue. Instead, here, I show that structure of the whole system is  significant in friction between brush covered surfaces and the  interpenetration is absolutely insignificant. The results of this  research would blow one\u2019s mind about how the polymer brush bilayers  respond at small shear rates.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1613987992}
