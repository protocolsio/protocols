A crossed factor simulation study was performed to investigate the power of the Koehler and Levin (1998)randomization test in an multiple baseline design. The results show that the degree of autocorrelation of the observations, the number of participants, the effect size, the overlap of possible start moments of the intervention between participants, the ratio of the number of measurements in the baseline- and intervention phase, a gradually emerging effect, and the number of measurements had strong main effects on the power. The two-way interactions between number of participants and effect size, and between the number of measurements and the number of start moments of the intervention also had a large effect. An online tool was developed to calculate the power of a multiple baseline design given several design characteristics.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1581091595}
