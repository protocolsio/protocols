Statistical and outcome measures will typically be assessed through ANOVA, Wilcoxon rank, and Fisher exact tests. Dimensionality reduction processes will be used to understand data structure and to identify clusters and cell types for statistical testing. Differential cluster abundance and differential gene expression using pseudobulk counts will be performed using relevant edgeR packages and applying a Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Power calculations for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis are based on relevant available data (e.g., Turner et al. 2020), and for assessing differential abundance and gene expression, for instance, we estimate that n=10 individuals per group are required to have \\u003e80% power to detect 30% differences between longitudinal samples (pre and post vaccination), with a false discovery rate of 5%. Given that there is expected variation in sample yield after fine needle aspiration which may be anatomically determined, there is a 50% overage in each group to allow for this and for any participants lost to follow up bringing the total to n=30.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"elmud\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"b6f4m\",\"text\":\"Single-cell repertoire analyses will be performed as previously described22,23,24.
