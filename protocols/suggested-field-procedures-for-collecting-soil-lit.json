In general, the soil fauna is extracted by Berlese-Tullgren apparatus (Southwood 1978, Andr\u00e9et al. 2002, Bano and Roy 2016), while the litter-dwelling and more active fauna is better surveyed with Winkler extractors (Besuchet et al. 1987, Agosti et al. 2000). Here, we used Berlese-Tullgren which represent the choice method for Collembola (Karyanto et al. 2008) but included in our samples both soil and litter.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1. Pilot study and designating sample locations<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.1.<\/span><span> Tropical rainforests can be rather heterogeneous in terms of forest age, composition and topography, including soil conditions. It is advisable to conduct a pilot study of the study area to estimate the different soil conditions and the number of soil samples that need to be obtained to be representative of the study area. For example, taking samples from a trail along a stream may lead to severely biased estimates of abundance and composition. An area of 50ha is appropriate for monitoring tropical trees (Losos and Leigh 2004), and smaller areas may be appropriate for most arthropods. Larger areas than 50ha may include a variety of habitats that may require high number of replicates to yield representative data. In our case the area of the ForestGEO permanent vegetation plot on Barro Colorado Island (Anderson\u2010Teixeira et al. 2015) is relatively homogenous. We took 100 samples each including 2 liters of scooped litter and soil dispersed over an area of ca. 60ha with good results (e.g. species accumulation curves near saturation).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.2. <\/span><span>Depending on the local rainfall regime, the sampling scheme should also address faunal seasonality. On Barro Colorado Island, distinct dry and wet seasons occur, with implications for the soil fauna (Levings and Windsor 1982). To account for arthropod seasonality, we collected 50 samples during the dry season and 50 samples during the wet season. This appears sound to estimates annual population indices (see item 9).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.3. <\/span><span>A random sampling scheme is also advisable. For example, this could be an evenly spaced grid system where samples are selected at random. On BCI, it is only possible to walk in designated trails inside the ForestGEO plot, to reduce seedling trampling within the plot (Goldsmith et al. 2006). In this case, we choose a stratified random sampling method, where samples were selected at random from a limited number of locations available (i.e., locations on trails). In our case we first selected 10 sections of 500m trails within\/near the plot, each with 50m landmarks. For one survey, we randomly chose five 50m-locations within one trail section (5 out of 10 locations possible). Then for each of the 5 chosen locations, we randomly selected one compass direction (45 deg. angles; 8 possible orientations). We went to the selected location, read the selected compass direction, walk 10m outside of the trail, and took the two paired samples there, each distant of 10cm (taxonomic and metabarcoding samples, see main text).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.4.<\/span><span> Avoid spatial autocorrelation between locations. This simplifies statistical analysis of data by preventing inflated degrees of freedom. For soil arthropods the minimal distance between samples can be short, as they typically do not move much around. In our case, the minimum distance between each paired sample was 50m. In these conditions spatial pseudoreplication was negligible (Basset et al. 2020).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.5.<\/span><span> Avoid taking samples near the nests of social insects (ants, termites), to avoid biased estimates of abundance\/occurrence in samples. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">2. Equipment<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">2.1. <\/span><span>Berlese-Tullgren.We used a collapsible (ideal for transport) Berlese-Tullgren, adapted after the commercial Bioquip model #2832 (Bioquip 2321 Gladwick Street, Rancho Dominguez, CA 90220, USA; <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bioquipinc.com\/catalog\/collecting-equipment-supplies\/traps\/collapsible-berlese-funnel-trap\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">https:\/\/bioquipinc.com\/catalog\/collecting-equipment-supplies\/traps\/collapsible-berlese-funnel-trap\/<\/span><\/a><span>). The funnel is 31 cm in diameter and 91 cm in height when extended. The upper portion of the funnel section is made of muslin to allow evaporation of moisture. The funnel is smooth with a plastic funnel at the bottom. A 0.635cm mesh galvanized metal screen is secured to the lower ring. The user can place a smaller mesh screen on top of this screen if desired. Ground litter from which insects are to be collected is placed on the screen. A lamp base with socket, on\/off knob, hanger loop, and cable are secured by a drawstring at the top of the funnel section. The unit operates on 120V AC electrical current, and a low-wattage light bulb (25W) is used to heat and dry out the material placed on the screen. The collector is a sterile plastic urine container (see item 2.3). A hole is drilled into the cap so that it can affixed to the plastic funnel. The container is filled with ethanol 95%.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">2.2.<\/span><span> Tools and small equipment needed, for 50 samples: garden spades to scoop litter and soil; brushes to clean tools and recipients; two spray bottles for bleach and distilled water; two plastic containers (20 liters each) for bleach and distilled water; a wooden frame of 20cm x 20cm (400 cm<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>) to delineate coarsely the sample; a graduated plastic container of 2 liters for calibrating the sample; 50 plastic boxes about 20cm x 10cm x 10cm (or larger) to hold each sample.
