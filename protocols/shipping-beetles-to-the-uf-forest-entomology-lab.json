Rest assured that they will be treated professionally.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">If you are sending them to be identified for your research, please make sure you provide all the information regarding collection date, country, locality, collection method, collector, and institution.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">If you are depositing the beetles into the UF Forest Entomology collection, here is how they may be used :<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2013 If your samples are of high quality (preserved in high-concentration, non-denatured ethanol from the moment of beetle death, and refrigerated) they will be deposited in -80C and in 99% ethanol, which will preserve them for molecular analyses of the beetles or the fungi vectored by the beetles. They may be used by our team or by anyone else in the global bark beetle research community.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>\u2013 If your samples are of lesser quality but still morphologically intact, they will be used in teaching, such as in the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ambrosiasymbiosis.org\/academy\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Bark Beetle Academy<\/span><\/a><span>.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Packaging<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1) Please put your specimens in ethanol in a plastic, screw-top vial. Do not use snap-top vials (sometimes called Eppendorf tubes) because they invariably pop open in high altitudes and leak. Do not use glass vials \u2013 they break.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2) Add a piece of soft napkin or cotton; this prevents the beetles from thrashing around and breaking their legs and antennae.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3) The ethanol is important to dehydrate, clean and preserve the specimens. However it is flammable, so you can\u2019t ship it legally. So after the specimens soak and dehydrate, we recommend pouring off about 90% of the ethanol so you can declare the shipment \u201cdry\u201d.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4) Place your vials on a sheet of paper and attach them with a sticky tape.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5) Put the whole thing into a padded envelope.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Shipping<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">You can send\u00a0 your package with regular mail.
