The use of chemical adjuncts to boost healing has been experimented in recent years. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of hyaluronic acid rinse in influencing the tensile strengths of commonly used sutures.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Materials and Methods: Two commonly used non-absorbable suture materials silk and polyamide were used for this in vitro study. Tensile strengths of the suture materials were determined pre and post immersion in hyaluronic acid (test) and chlorhexidine (control).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Results: Polyamide showed better stability in terms of tensile strength when compared to silk. Hyaluronic acid as a chemical adjunct did not alter the tensile strengths of both suture materials pre and post immersion.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Conclusion: This in vitro study has shown a promising property of hyaluronic acid with relation to stabilization of tensile strength of suture materials which needs to be evaluated in clinical settings.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1584547563}
