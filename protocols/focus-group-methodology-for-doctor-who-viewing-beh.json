When studying concepts of empathy, landscape interpretation, and science fiction fandom, focus groups are particularly effective in testing not only individual reactions to a show but also collective responses to themes and plot points. For this study, focus groups were held in which viewers possessing various levels of Doctor Who fandom watched an episode, followed by a collective discussion between the moderator and participants on themes of landscape, empathy, and emotional geographies within the plot. The results of the focus groups shed light on not only how viewers respond to themes of empathy and landscape in a show, but also how the presence (or absence) of fandom influences the viewing experience. Geographically, this work speaks to media\u2019s potential to project certain messages across audiences with varying levels of engagement. This is particularly significant as media increasingly engage with ideologies, mobilities, and opinions across the world. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Note: The workflow described here was used in Hannah Gunderman's dissertation for fulfillment of the Ph.D. in Geography from UT-Knoxville in 2018.
