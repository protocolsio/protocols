However if eyesight is totally lost this is a different matter. Vulture wildlife admissions have often suffered trauma. \nSome 30% of all raptor trauma cases, has suffered eye damage and in 70% of these cases the only damage is seen in the posterior segment, (i.e. behind the lens, where it cannot be seen without use of an ophthalmoscope), this will typically comprise haemorrhage or retinal detachment behind the lens and often goes unappreciated as looking at the birds eye with the naked eye, no abnormality is seen. A traumatised bird can suffer damage to both eyes although this is relatively rare, however a vulture initially suffering damage to one eye will typically manage well, until the second eye is also damaged. <\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","note":null,"link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"302E7D4D408A4B2783FC9CDE50E47907","order_id":3,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">There are many potential diagnosis, such as cataract formation, neoplasia, dry eye, uveitis, parasitic infestation, bacterial infection in the globe, penetrating lesions, glaucoma, insect stings.
