The meta-analysis was carried out with Meta-DiSc 1.4 and STATA 14.0 statistical software. The sensitivity was defined as the proportion of patients with ctDNA presence among all patients confirmed as having cervical cancer. The specificity was defined as the proportion of patients with negative ctDNA detection among all negative control volunteers without cervical cancer. The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was calculated as sensitivity\/(1 \u2013 specificity), whereas the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was calculated as 1 \u2013 sensitivity\/specificity. DOR was calculated as PLR \/ NLR and was used as an indication of how much greater the chance was of having cervical cancer for patients with ctDNA presence than for those without ctDNA. These indicators were summarized using a bivariate meta-analysis model, and the threshold effect was determined by receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve and Spearman correlation analyses; P values of less than 0.05 indicated a significant threshold effect.
