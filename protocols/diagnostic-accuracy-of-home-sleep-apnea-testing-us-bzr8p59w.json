Of these, an estimated 425 million suffer from moderate or severe disease (1). Evidence has suggested OSA is associated with an increased incidence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and stroke, and early diagnosis is important to prevent these complications. The gold standard for diagnosing OSA is in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). However, PSG is expensive, labor intensive, limited in available facilities, and can result in long waiting times(2, 3). The home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) has been developed to solve these problems. The American Academy of Sleep medicine (AASM) guidelines recommend HSAT with at least nasal pressure, chest and abdominal respiratory inductance plethysmography, and oximetry or peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) with oximetry and actigraphy (4). Sleep studies are classified as Type I-IV, with Type â…¢ recording two respiratory variables, oxygen saturation, and one cardiac variable. (4)A meta-analysis of HSAT suggested that HSAT alone could not be the gold standard test for OSA due to the low sensitivity and specificity. However, the meta-analysis did not include studies that uses HSAT with PAT (5). Watch-peripheral arterial tone (WatchPAT), one of the HSATs, is a device that uses PAT can be worn like a wristwatch and continuously records PAT, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and actigraphy at night. PAT signals are measured continuously in the peripheral arterial bed of the fingertip. WatchPAT can indirectly detect apneic/hypopneic events by monitoring PAT because PAT reflects physiological changes in pulsatile arterial volume that are modulated by sympathetic nerve activity (6). While other HSAT cannot accurately measure total sleep time, WatchPAT can accurately measure actual total sleep time (7), which may increase sensitivity. WatchPAT is simple and can be an alternative diagnostic tool to PSG if it has sufficient diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, NightOwl is another HSAT that uses PAT(8). This review will investigate the diagnostic accuracy of HSAT using PAT and determine whether HSAT using PAT are replaceable for PSG. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"3kl6c\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"2ilp4\",\"text\":\"OBJECTIVE \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":10}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"7flqs\",\"text\":\"This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of HSAT using PAT for OSA among patients suspected of having OSA and to determine if PSG can be replaced by HSAT using PAT.
