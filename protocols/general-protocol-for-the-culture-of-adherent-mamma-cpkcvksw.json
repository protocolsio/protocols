The most common cell culture flasks that you are likely to encounter are called T-25 flasks, T-75 flasks and T-160 flasks. These flasks have a surface area of 25 cm2, 75 cm2, and 160 cm2, respectively. Typically, I use T-75 flasks for general maintenance and use T-25 flasks to seed cells that have just been thawed (you never really know how many cells will still be alive after freezing, but you definitely don’t want to have the cells be too sparse in a flask, as they will grow extremely slowly). T-160 flasks can be used if you need a large number of cells when you are doing things like protein expression. Cell culture dishes also come in various sizes and are typically used when you will need to quickly harvest your cells for an experiment via cell scrapper. Rather than going through the long and potentially destructive process of trypsinization, you can simply harvest clumps of your cells using a cell scrapper. I have done this in the past by adding cell lysis solution to my cell culture dish and then using a cell scrapper to quickly lyse the cells and isolate DNA and RNA.

To do this, you simply divide the number of cells that you seed by the surface area of the flask to get cells per cm2.

For example, someone might give you a vial of cells that say Passage 8 or P8 on it. This means that, since the person who froze down the cells received or created the cells, they have been passaged 8 times. In general, the passage number is not always accurate, as it does not necessarily reflect how many times a cell line has been passaged prior to being received. For example, if you purchase a cell culture stock from a company, you may say that these are Passage 1 cells, as you have only thawed and seeded them into a flask. However, you do not know how many times these cells were passaged by the people who originally handled and froze the cells. In general, however, passage number is a good indicator of how many times you yourself have passaged the cells. For experiments, it is generally best to use lower passage number cells. For example, when you have the choice to use Passage 3 cells versus Passage 12 cells for an important experiment, it is probably best to use the Passage 3 cells. This is because cells can only divide a certain number of times before becoming senescent and becoming permanently arrested. This is also why it is a good idea to freeze down a batch of low passage number stocks to use in the future. Some cell lines, referred to as immortal cell lines (such as HeLa cells), can be passaged indefinitely. However, if your cell line is not immortalized it is likely that they will stop dividing after a certain number of divisions. As for how many cell divisions it will take before senescence sets in, you will just have to figure it out over
