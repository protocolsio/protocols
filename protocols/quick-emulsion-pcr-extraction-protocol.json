In this report, we have described a \u2018Quick ePCR extraction protocol\u2019 for the purification of ePCR products, which directly employs silica-based DNA purification columns and the products purified using this method have been found to be compatible with gene cloning and NGS applications.  The method described here makes ePCR easy, safe and within the reach of every laboratory. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1582115069}
