For this purpose an automatic program (P1) consisting of three evacuation and three filling steps (two with N2 and last one with gas mix) was established. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Remember: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">A) Light objects like towels will be flying or slightly moving in an Airlock during the procedure because of an over- and down-pressure changes. Be carefull about a staff you are putting in, protect it from a damage.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">B) Everything that is tightly closed (bottles with media or chemicals, tubes etc.) has to be made anoxic before putting inside. Also consumables that are pre-packed (sterile serological pipettes, tips, Petri dishes) will still keep some oxygen after the Air-lock procedure. In some cases it is useful to make a small holes into packaging before to improve speed of gases exchange but it will loss the sterility.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Lab personnel access the chambre to perform their operations through <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">glove ports<\/span><span>.

However, the hydrogen\u00a0concentration inside the tent must be always kept under 5% unless the gas mixture may be explosive.\u00a0 4% of hydrogen is an optimal concentration that is non-flamable and still provides enough hydrogen for oxygen removal. In our anaerobic chambre gas mixture N2\/H2 (95%\/5% respectively) is used.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1599656221}
