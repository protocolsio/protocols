The lack of clarity is evident in the plethora of terms in use. For example, within healthcare we witness services, programmes and interventions being ‘co-created’, ‘co-designed’, ‘co-evaluated’ or ‘co-implemented’. This can involve stakeholder and public engagement through participation or involvement in any or all steps of the applied research cycle (1,2). All are regarded as processes of co-production but the way they are enacted and operationalised varies depending on the purpose, what is being co-produced, and by whom (3,4). Some of the ambiguity in co-production also comes from its unclear relationship with Patient and Public Involvement/and Engagement (PPI/E). For some, co-production represents enhanced PPI/E, a way to improve on its shortcomings by re-engaging with the principles of power-sharing, equality and social justice, and reinforcing the democratic right of citizens to influence healthcare (3,5). For others, co-production simply represents another way of consulting the public and service users to provide instrumental inputs into health and social care services and research, demonstrating a more technocratic rationale (6). New experimental perspectives on co-production, which frame it as a generative process and a social space within which new interactions, insights and knowledge are produced, challenge conventional notions of engagement and involvement (4). However, whilst new conceptualisations and discussion can help the approach and foundational principles to further develop and evolve, and more and different forms of co-production to emerge, this also adds to the uncertainty around its use.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1862l\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"9kpt2\",\"text\":\"The UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) recently embraced co-production as a means of improving public involvement in research, framing it as a more collaborative and egalitarian mode of involvement with values and principles for greater equality (7). Unlike other funders of health research globally, NIHR insists on community involvement in research proposals, and it is a key criterion for funding (8). Other funders have started to encourage co-production by providing flexible funding to cover costs of user-led research design and engagement (9)and funding research into best practice for community engagement (10). In the UK context, some argue that the architecture of the new NIHR Applied Research Collaboration funding model enables authentic and visible co-production (11). Others are more cautious, arguing that co-production can only be as successful as the system allows, and that traditional research structures often fail to facilitate effective public involvement, leading to co-opting of the term co-production without making a tangible difference (12,13). However, there are anecdotal stories of successful collaborative working from the previous NIHR funding model, Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research (CLAHRC), where co-production projects added value and led to the implementation of novel services and interventions (14). Success stories like these are not always published or reported on or described in a way that explicates how best to support researchers to co-produce applied health research or complex health interventions.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"5tp0l\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1a1n7\",\"text\":\"Recent systematic reviews of co-production have summarised the different co-production approaches in use, collated outcomes and effects of co-production, and some have focused specifically on replicability and reporting. Slattery conducted a rapid review of research co-design in health settings and effectiveness in the design phase of research and found that co-design is widely used but rarely reported or evaluated in detail (15). Another review examining the use of experienced based co-design in health service improvement also found inconsistent reporting and variation in use of the approach, leading the authors to argue for reporting guidelines to encourage consistency and improve the potential of the approach (13). Halvorsrud pooled effects data from co-creation projects in international health research and found moderate to small effects on a range of outcomes from different study designs and interventions, yet little evidence of longer-term effects of co-creation (16). Acknowledging the lack of evidence of the impact of co-produced or co-created interventions in healthcare settings, some authors have reviewed the evidence on outcomes and factors influencing the quality and level of co-production and co-creation (17,18).

Applied health research is becoming more collaborative, with patient and public groups increasingly engaged in research projects alongside academics and practitioners, and funders are gradually mandating use of co-production principles.
