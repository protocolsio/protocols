Since an individual may be exposed to pollutants present in the workplace, and at the same time, the population may be exposed to multiple sources of environmental contamination (for example water, soil and air) and socioeconomic deprivation, assess the possible association between environmental exposures, both at the individual and area level, it could improve the understanding of how these variables would affect pregnant women and the developing fetus. To provide an overview about updated information related to those factors and its association with NTD and OFC, we consider performing a scoping review. The aim of this publication is to present a scoping review protocol about the relationship between environmental exposures and the etiology of CFBD. <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods and analysis:<\/span><span> the identification of the papers for this review was done through a search strategy using MeSH vocabulary, in the electronic database PUBMED MEDLINE and SCIELO.
