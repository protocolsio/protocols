Beetle luciferases catalyze a bioluminescent reaction by oxidizing D-luciferin with molecular oxygen. This also requires ATP as second substrate to first convert D-luciferin into the activated lucyferyl-adenylate form. Luciferases are widely used as reporter genes, most commonly via lytic assays of cell cultures and tissues. D-luciferin is relatively stable is solution for many days, so the beetle luciferase reaction can also be monitored in real time in live cell and tissue cultures for many days. Bioluminescence imaging is often used to track tumor development in live mice by if cancer cells are labeled with a luciferase. When injected into mice, D-luciferin is relatively quickly eliminated from the bloodstream (~30 min half-life). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Drosophila<\/span><span> flies expressing a beetle luciferase gene produce bioluminescence if fed with a food containing luciferin. Bioluminescence in flies appears within a minute and peaks within 2-3 minutes after a food ingestion. When refraining from eating or placed on a luciferin-free food, fly bioluminescence decays with about 1 hour half-life and essentially returns to the baseline after 4 hours. Naturally, flies tend to eat sporadically and often make intervals of many hours between eating. This makes beetle luciferase bioluminescence a very convenient system to monitor fly feeding timing and, to a considerable extent, food intake in real time for many days (see the Abstract Figure). In this protocol I describe one of the possible procedures to monitor fly feeding using commonly available plate readers, outline a historical background on recording bioluminescence in live flies to study circadian gene expression, illustrate several examples of feeding behaviors that can be analyzed by this procedure and discuss some potential applications.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1616268786}
