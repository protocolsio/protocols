This pathway surveils lysosomes and selectively demarcates terminally damaged lysosomes for elimination. Among the most upstream signaling proteins in this pathway are the glycan binding proteins-Galectins-which recognize N and O linked glycan chains on the luminal side of transmembrane lysosomal proteins. These glycosyl modifications are only accessible to galectin proteins upon extensive lysosomal membrane rupture and serve as a sensitive measure of lysosomal damage and eventual clearance by selective autophagy. Indeed, prior work has shown that immunofluorescence of Galectin-3 serves as a convenient proxy for lysophagic flux in tissue culture cells (Aits et al., 2015; Maejima et al., 2013). Here we describe a facile method for monitoring lysophagy using the acid sensitive fluorophore mKeima, affixed onto Galectin-3, which allows for the monitoring of lysophagic flux by Flow cytometry, Western blotting or Confocal imaging. This method, which we have termed Lyso-Keima, serves as a facile and quantitative assay for monitoring lysophagy in tissue culture cells.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1631646778}
