These backup tips replace tips in the larger container where no seeds germinated on the surface. For a small scale experiment to test out medium and growth conditions this approach can work as well. Medium should be exchanged twice a week. Also, watch the falcons closely for contamination with algae and microorganisms. <\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/de4fbe2wf.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"CA2FBC70898145FF9280BCDEAA61FA94","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/de4bbe2wf.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"61CB263BC13A49168AEEA0A34389EF64","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/de4fbe2wf.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA9F6C","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[{"id":238338,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Finntip&trade; Pipette Tips, 10mL, sterile","linfor":"","url":"https:\/\/www.thermofisher.com\/order\/catalog\/product\/9402163","sku":"9402163","cas_number":"","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Thermo Fisher","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"note":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.thermofisher.com","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/440.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/440.png"},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":440},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}}],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Plant roots are fascinating organs that anchor the plant in the ground, take up water and nutrients and are the interaction zone for plants with their surrounding microbial rhizosphere. In contrast to easily accessible leaves, the study of these belowground organs is more difficult as harvesting the tissue is time-consuming and - when sampled as whole - kills the entire plant. The time-consuming and often disruptive process of root harvest can hamper molecular studies that require for samples to be harvested in a narrow time frame in order to rule out negative sample bias such as circadian gene regulation or effects that stem of the sample handling rather than the actual assay.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>For our studies of the soil-borne pathogen <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Plasmodiophora brassicae<\/span><span> in interaction with soil microbes in roots we needed a plant cultivation method that allows quick and easy harvest of root tissue while at the same time allowing the roots to form the pathogen-specific clubbed root structures. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We therefore came up with an easy custom-build setup, that can be easily implemented in other laboratories using similar materials. Our setup requires clear square plastic containers high enough to keep our desired plant species (Arabidopsis and Brassica) and a custom-build rack with holes that fit 10ml pipette tips. This setup allows easy cultivation of plants in sand and hydroponic medium and largely damage-free root harvest within several seconds for each plant. This method allowed us to harvest samples for a large microarray experiment as well as countless experiments for root transcript studies. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Since the height of the box and the extend of the pipette tips is a limiting factor we suggest to use this system only for relatively small plants such as Arabidopsis or young stages of larger plants such as <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Brassica rapa<\/span><span> or <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Brassica napus<\/span><span>.   <\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1619538569}
