The peptides were analyzed using reversed-phase nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The system consisted of a column; initially, the sample would be subjected to Agilent Binary LC1290 using column Polaris, high-performance chip, 360 nl enrichment chip (150mm X 75\u00b5m), and a separation column G4240-62030 with a thermostat temperature of 4\u00b0C. The mobile phase was Water (0.1% Formic Acid) and Acetonitrile: Water (90:10 v\/v). The chromatography was carried out in a gradient manner (3% to 90% Acetonitrile: Water). The mass spec analysis was carried out on Agilent 6540 UHD QTOF MS (Gas temp: 250, Gas flow (l\/minute): 8 minutes,) MS analysis was carried out in a data-dependent manner with survey scan resolution. Mass range: 250-1700(m\/z), MS\/MS: 50-1700(m\/z), Data type: Centroid and software: Masshunter workstation software. Obtained data were searched against the UniProt protein databases of all the respective four Bacillus sp. using default parameters. <\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1596656065}
