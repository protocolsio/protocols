To rescue WDR81 siRNA-induced accumulation of polyQ foci, cells were first treated with control or WDR81 siRNA, then 3 mg of vector expressing siRNA-resistant WDR81 were transfected into the same cells simultaneous with the induction of Htt97Q-EGFP expression by doxycycline. siRNA treatments were performed twice more as above and polyQ foci were scored 48 h post induction of Htt97Q-EGFP expression.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">C. elegans <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">genetics<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">C. elegans <\/span><span>Bristol strain N2 was used as wild type.<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">\u00a0sorf-2(tm5210) <\/span><span>deletion mutants were provided by Dr. Shohei Mitani (Tokyo Women\u2019s Medical University, Japan).

Sections were then incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200) at room temperature for 3 hours. After 4 washes in PBS, 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was added for 1 min at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 2 min. The IHC pictures were obtained by Nikon microscope (Ts2R). Results were calculated by software Image J and NIS-Element, BR. 3.00 (Nikon).
