MPT disapproves of most theories of psychotherapy, wherein psychoanalysts, exaggerating the past, place individuals in very deep holes and indoctrinate them with some disgusting lies, and in fact, instill truths in their own minds and suggest a difficult way to cope with them. The analytical method has been also exploited to reflect on the theory of MPT.
