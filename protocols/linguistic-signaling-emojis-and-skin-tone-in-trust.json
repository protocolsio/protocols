Decomposing chat logs, I find that trust increases dramatically with the introduction of emojis to one-shot games, while reciprocation increases only modestly. Skin tones embeddedin emojis impact sharing and resulting gains \u2013 to the benefit of some anddetriment to others. Both light and dark skin players trust less on receipt of a dark skin tone emoji \u2013 suggestive of statistical discrimination. In this way, computer-mediated communication leads to reduced gains for dark-skinned persons. These results highlight the complex social judgment that motivates trust in an anonymous counterpart.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1588952571}
