All patients hospitalized in ICU for >3 days and with available serum troponin I data from December 2015 to July 2017 were included. Patients with definite diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were excluded. We divided patients with troponin I elevation into three groups; no prescription, chronic prescription and new prescription of antithrombotic agents during ICU admission. We defined new prescription when patients were on antithrombotic agents, including antiplatelet agents, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin after troponin I was found to be elevated at ICU admission and chronic prescription, if antithrombotic agents were on medication list more than 30 days before ICU admission. Primary outcomes were 30-day and one-year all-cause mortality. Of 597 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 407 (68%) patients had elevated troponin I (>0.1 ng\/mL) on ICU admission. These patients had increased 30-day [hazard ratio (HR), 1.679; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.132\u20132.491; <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p<\/span><span> = 0.009] and one-year (HR, 1.568; 95% CI, 1.180\u20132.083; <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p <\/span><span>= 0.002) all-cause mortality compared with those without elevated troponin I. In patients with elevated troponin I, there was no significant difference of 30-day all-cause mortality among three groups (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p<\/span><span> = 0.051) whereas patients on chronic prescription showed significant survival benefit in one-year all-cause mortality when compared to those without or with new prescription (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p<\/span><span>= 0.008).<\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusions<\/span><span>: In critically ill patients, elevated troponin I in the absence of AMI was associated with poor prognosis.
