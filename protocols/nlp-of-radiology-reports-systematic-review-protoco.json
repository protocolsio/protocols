\"text-block\">(2)Has the use of these methods changed over between 2015 and 2019?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(3)What are the clinical applications of these natural language processing methods?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(4)Are datasets and codes of natural language processing available in published studies 2015-2019? <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Searches<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We developed an automated search strategy in Google Scholar with additional metadata collected from crossref, pubmed, semantic scholar, arxiv and unpaywall. Search terms include (\"radiology\" OR \"radiologist\") AND (\"natural language\" OR \"text mining\" OR \"information extraction\" OR \"document classification\" OR \"word2vec\") NOT patient. Citations retrieved underwent a snowballing process whereby a reference list of the previous systematic review (Pons et al) is also included. We then applied an automatic exclusion of citations if the citation is: (1) non-English; (2) a patent document; (3) published before 2015; (4) a review article; (5) about radiology images only rather than reports;(6) not relating to radiology; (7) not natural language processing; (8) not available in full text; (9) duplicates; (10) reviews, conference abstracts, comments, or editorials; and (11) case reports.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Condition or domain being studied<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Natural language processing of radiology reports<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Participants\/population<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Patients who underwent any radiological investigation from which a report was generated. We exclude studies of patients in whom radiological images were analysed without radiology reports. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Interventions, exposures<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">No specified exposure<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Comparators\/control<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">There are two main groups of comparators. Studies may compare their NLP systems with expert annotated radiology reports or may compare it with another NLP systems. We anticipate some studies comparing several NLP systems or in combination with expert-annotated reports. Expert-annotated reports would be considered the control. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Types of study to be included<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We include cross-sectional studies where a corpus of radiology reports was annotated and\/or analysed. Studies that adopted a pseudo-case-control where they included radiology reports from patients with or without a disease of interest are included. We also include cohort studies where outputs from text analytic systems were used as exposures\/outcomes. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We exclude a study if it is: (1) a case report; (2) published before 2015; (3) in language other than English; (4) relating to radiology images only; (5) a review\/conference abstract\/comments\/editorial; (6) not reporting descriptive\/outcomes of interest; (7) not relating to radiology report; (8) not using natural language processing methods; (9) not available in full text; (10) duplications. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Main outcomes<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The main outcome is the performance of the NLP being used to perform the designated task. However, this <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">may not be applicable to studies that used NLP for cohort selection in epidemiological studies. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Measures of effect<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The main outcomes are the precision (positive predictive value), recall (sensitivity), and F1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) associated with the NLP being used to perform the designated task (where applicable).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Additional outcomes<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Not applicable<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Measures of effect<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Not applicable<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Data extraction<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Three reviewers screened all titles and abstracts of potentially eligible studies from the search strategy using Rayyan online platform. We discussed and resolved citations where two reviewers excluded it and one reviewer included it. All other citations were included for full eligibility assessment. A team of six reviewers assessed eligibility of the resulting citations with each study. We plan to double-review the included studies. We use a pre-specified data collection tool for recording eligibility assessment outcomes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Data items extracted from studies include: study primary objective, data source(s), study period, language of radiology reports, anatomical region, imaging modality, disease area, size of dataset, annotated set size, training set size, validation set size, test set size, external validation performed, domain expert used, number of annotators, inter-annotator agreement, natural language processing technique(s) used, best reported recall, best reported precision, best reported F1 score, availability of dataset, and availability of code. Data extraction is performed by two reviewers independently. Recording of data extraction is done through a shared data collection tool. Any disagreement will be resolved by discussion during 2-weekly review team meeting.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Risk of bias (quality) assessment<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">There is currently no risk of bias tools applicable to the anticipated heterogeneous types of studies in this review. However, we adopted aspects of the ROBINS-E tool to assess epidemiological aspects of the studies, where appropriate. Risk of bias measures relating to technical aspects were developed by the review team who has considerable knowledge on text analytic methods. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Strategy for data synthesis<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Our objective is to provide descriptive data. We do not plan to summarise data using meta-analysis because of the anticipated heterogeneous study design, objectives, natural language processing techniques, and reported outcomes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Analysis of subgroups or subsets<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will report descriptive statistics stratified by disease areas, NLP techniques, and year of publication. No meta-analysis will be performed.<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1601797328}
