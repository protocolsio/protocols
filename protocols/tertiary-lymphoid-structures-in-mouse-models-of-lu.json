In humans, they have been shown to develop in and around many different types of tumors, and often lead to a more promising prognosis when found. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), they have a highly beneficial effect on patients' survival. What remains to be studied is the heterogeneity of the TLSs and the mechanisms of their development. In order to study these important aspects of the immune response to NSCLC, we developed a protocol to image a time course of TLS development in murine bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and adenocarcinomas, and further expanded on how to quantify, and therefore characterize, these structures.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1622776828}
