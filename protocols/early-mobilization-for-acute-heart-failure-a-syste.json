For patients with heart failure, exercise therapy when their condition has stabilized has been shown to improve quality of life and reduce readmission rates. Although scoping reviews have been reported on early mobilization after acute myocardial infarction, no systematic review of early mobilization in patients with heart failure who are older and have a higher rate of multiple disabilities and physical deterioration than those with myocardial infarction has been reported, and its definition, efficacy, and safety have not been fully clarified. In heart failure, physical functions such as grip strength and activity of daily living (ADL) have been found to be associated with distant outcomes such as readmission rates and mortality, and early mobilization for acute heart failure, initiated to prevent physical conditioning and decline in ADLs, can contribute to these outcomes.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Purpose<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    The purpose of this study is to conduct a scoping review and systematic review of early mobilization for hospitalized heart failure to clarify its current definition and to evaluate its effectiveness and safety.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Method and analysis<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">[Part 1]<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Scoping review of early mobilization for heart failure (clinical definition)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of our scoping review is to clarify current clinical definition of early mobilization for acute heart failure.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We describe this protocol that follows the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement.
