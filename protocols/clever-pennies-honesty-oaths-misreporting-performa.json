We execute a field experiment on Amazon MTurk to  determine  whether  honesty  oaths  impact  the  cost  of  worker  lies.  Employing  a  design that follows the \u201cdie roll\u201d paradigm, we determine that oaths elicit more truthful behavior, although they primarily impact extreme lies.  Oath-taking decreased the cost of misreportingby 12%.  While shirking is widespread, oaths marginally decrease it.  Male workers misreport performance more often on average than females, yet both sexes are equally responsive to oath-taking.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">JEL Codes: D90, D91, C8, C93, J9<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1595529671}
