To ensure that each LED creates a distinct peak in the irradiance signal, we do not measure all the LEDs in one pass. Instead we measure all LEDs over the course of four passes in which we raster the optical power meter across the optoPlate such that every other LED encountered is inactive, leading to an irradiance signal in which measurements from inactive LEDs create clear troughs between measurements of bright LEDs. We do this by setting the optoPlate to deliver a checkerboard illumination pattern, such that no two illuminated wells are directly above, below, or beside each other in a given pass. We measure the remaining wells by setting the optoPlate to deliver the inverse checkerboard illumination pattern. Because each well of the optoPlate has two LEDs, we repeat this process twice, once for the left LED and once for the right LED. Once all 192 LEDs are measured, we analyze the irradiance measurements using a MATLAB script that determines the brightness of each LED and calculates a calibration value so that the brightest LEDs are dimmed to match the dimmest LED. We then flash the calibration values to the optoPlate and repeat the whole process until the coefficient of variation of the LED irradiance measurements falls below a set threshold (we use 1%).<\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":985537,"guid":"0813EE60CC2D11EA89BC93F13C9C6512","previous_id":985811,"previous_guid":"44DBD6A0CC4111EA9FAAADA94ABF0CD3","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"F23C227B38F84E7AB379207F8EC33C15","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Calibrating an optoPlate with two LEDs"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"53B703FF7BF147868D0781520B99D63C","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Mount a Nunc 96 well optical-bottom plate to the microscope stage (Figure S3B).

It should be noted that this script assumes the wells are measured in a set order in which 1) the microscope rasters through a 96 well plate mounted on its programmable stage from A1-A12 to B12-B1 and so on and 2) the optoPlate is flipped when mounted upside-down on the 96 well plate so that these measurements actually correspond to optoPlate wells A12-A1 to B1-B12 etc. Flashing the optoPlate with CHECKER01.mat sets the checkerboard pattern in which the LEDs of optoPlate well A01 are active, while CHECKER02.mat sets the checkerboard pattern in which the LEDs of optoPlate well A01 are inactive. By default, the calibration script assumes an optoPlate configuration with two LEDs of the same color per well. If this is not the case, set the variable \u2018calibrate_LEDs_independently\u2019 to true and the script will treat each set of LEDs (LED01, LED02, etc.) as separate groups of different colored LEDs when calculating calibration values.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":985547,"guid":"57787C50CC2D11EA89BC93F13C9C6512","previous_id":985546,"previous_guid":"4FABB870CC2D11EA89BC93F13C9C6512","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"EF03FC5E7B8445D09434BA8AB7292610","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Calibrating an optoPlate with two LEDs"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"1E65AF8D40614AD5A5D241F99E9D943A","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Flash the updated calibration values to the optoPlate.

Until recently, there had been few instruments available for applying controlled light doses to cultures of cells. The optoPlate, a programmable array of 192 LEDs, was developed to meet this need. However, LED performance varies and without calibration there are substantial brightness differences between LEDs on an optoPlate. Here we present a method for calibrating an optoPlate that uses a programmable microscope stage and optical power meter to automatically measure all 192 LEDs of an optoPlate. The resulting brightness measurements are used to calculate calibration values that tune the electrical current supplied to each optoPlate LED to reduce brightness variation in optogenetic experiments.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1595462034}
