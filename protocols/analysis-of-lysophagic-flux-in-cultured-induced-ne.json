This pathway surveils lysosomes and selectively demarcates terminally damaged lysosomes for elimination. Among the most upstream signaling proteins in this pathway are the glycan binding proteins-Galectins-which recognize N and O linked glycan chains on the luminal side of transmembrane lysosomal proteins. These glycosyl modifications are only accessible to galectin proteins upon extensive lysosomal membrane rupture and serve as a sensitive measure of lysosomal damage and eventual clearance by selective autophagy. Indeed, prior work has shown that immunofluorescence of Galectin-3 serves as a convenient proxy for lysophagic flux in tissue culture cells (Aits et al., 2015; Maejima et al., 2013). Here we describe our method for monitoring GFP positive RFP-GFP-galectin-3 GFP positive puncta clearance as a proxy for turnover of damaged lysosomes via immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1631645547}
