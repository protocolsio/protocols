The phytoestrogen-fertility relationship is well-documented in livestock, rhinoceroses, cheetahs, and pandas, and this study will characterize the pattern in primates, especially pygmy slow lorises, gorillas, and pottos. We will adapt existing biomedical methods to investigate dietary estrogens and reproductive outcomes in captive primates. Gene expression profiles will serve as proxies for in vivo estrogen receptor activity, and our heterologous cell-based receptor reporter assay will quantify in vitro estrogen receptor activation. Generalized linear mixed-effects models will integrate these parameters with reproductive outcomes to test the effect of gene expression profiles and diet estrogenicity on fertility.
