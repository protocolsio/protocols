A color-coded tagging system is used to mark and track individual plants selected for pollination and to maintain any genotype-to-phenotype links. Unique tag IDs include a location code, a year code, a unique number, and a color code (e.g. N12001g = Newark, DE 2012 001 green). The tags for male plants have a five-day color sequence. In the fashion of a heat map, the following color sequence is recommended for tagging males across sequential days: w (white), y (yellow), o (orange), s (strawberry), r (red). You may want to hand-mark colored tags into 5-day sets (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) to distinguish repeating instances of the same color separated by 5 days. Tags for female plants are a single color (green) that is different from the male colored tags. On each male and female tag, mark the date it is placed on a plant.

In the fashion of a heat map, the following color sequence is recommended for tagging males across sequential days: w (white), y (yellow), o (orange), s (strawberry), r (red). You may want to hand-mark colored tags into 5-day sets (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) to distinguish repeating instances of the same color separated by 5 days.

A tropical synthetic (TropicS) population was systematically selected for early flowering time at multiple locations managed by a team of research groups (project PIs: N. de Leon; S. Flint-Garcia; J.

The protocol outlines experimental techniques and guidance for planting, sample tracking, tissue sampling, pollination, harvesting and record keeping.
