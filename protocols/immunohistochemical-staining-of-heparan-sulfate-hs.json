HS and Col18 HSPG core proteins were detected immunohistochemically using 10E4 anti-HS (US Biological\/Amsbio) and anti-Col18 (Santa Cruz), respectively, with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (Dako). Background staining was checked using the corresponding isotype control Ig instead of the primary antibody. 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) was used as the chromogen. For morphometry, stained sections were imaged using a light microscope with attached camera (Olympus BX41).
