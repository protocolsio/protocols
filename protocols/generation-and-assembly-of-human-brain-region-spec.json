In this protocol, we describe how to generate and assemble subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids, also known as brain region\u2013specific organoids, from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). We describe how to pattern the neural spheroids toward either a dorsal forebrain or a ventral forebrain fate, establishing human cortical spheroids (hCSs) and human subpallial spheroids (hSSs), respectively. We also describe how to combine the neural spheroids in vitro to assemble forebrain assembloids that recapitulate the interactions of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons seen in vivo. Astrocytes are also present in the human forebrain\u2013specific spheroids, and these undergo maturation when the forebrain spheroids are cultured long term. The initial generation of neural spheroids from hPSCs occurs in <1 week, with regional patterning occurring over the subsequent 5 weeks. After the maturation stage, brain region\u2013specific spheroids are amenable to a variety of assays, including live-cell imaging, calcium dynamics, electrophysiology, cell purification, single-cell transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry studies. Once generated, forebrain spheroids can also be matured for >24 months in culture.<\/span><span><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Introduction<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Understanding the development of the human nervous system and elucidating the mechanisms that lead to brain disorders represent some of the most challenging ongoing endeavors in neurobiology. One major obstacle is the restricted access to healthy and diseased human brain tissue for functional molecular and cellular studies. As a result, experimental paradigms have been largely confined to animal models or in vitro cell culture systems that do not fully recapitulate the developmental, architectural, and species-specific aspects of the human brain. Thus, there is a great need for humanderived model systems that recapitulate features of human CNS development and allow for the study of these processes in both healthy and diseased conditions.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1590555057}
