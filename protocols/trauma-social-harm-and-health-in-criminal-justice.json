But we still know relatively little about the interventions meant to prevent and tackle female criminal behaviour. Research studies often do not calculate or report their results about women, are mostly conducted in prison and very little research is conducted with justice involved women in the community.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Currently,Women\u2019s Centres which support criminal justice involved women in the UK, all use different assessments of risks (for example of re-offending) and needs of the women who come to them for support. None of the current assessments are independently and publicly validated or demonstrate statistically significant scales with robust scoring and weighting.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In 2017, we independently reviewed 136 peer-reviewed tools for assessing the needs and outcomes of justice involved women, and concluded that the Women\u2019s Risk Needs Assessment (WRNA) was the most validated, gender responsive and trauma-informed tool for this population internationally. This study will be the first to validate the WRNA Probation module, in England and it will test how accurate the assessment is with criminal justice involved women in this national context.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Study Design: <\/span><span>An observational validation study to test the predictive validity of the WRNA in England.Criminal justice involved women seeking support from Women\u2019s Centres following release from custody will be identified by caseworkers as potential participant and consented to the study. In the initial caseworker interview, participants will undertake the WRNA assessment that identifies risks, needs and strengths that predict criminal behaviour. Follow up will be conducted at 6 and 12 months using criminal offending data to link to recidivism and assess the predictive accuracy of the WRNA.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Study Participants<\/span><span>: English speaking women who are over 18, with involvement in the criminal justice system (police custody\/triage\/probation\/prison or at risk of justice involvement) who have capacity to consent to involvement will be included in the study.Participants will be recruited from the following pathways which feed into the Women\u2019s Centres:Through-the-gate support following prison (TTG); Release on temporary license (ROTL) services; or, through Liaison and Diversion (L&D) from Police custody, street triage or community (probation) referrals received by the Women\u2019s Resource Centres (WRCs) caseworkers from other services. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Sample Size: <\/span><span>It is estimated that 700 criminal justice involved women in England are required for the validation, to allow for attrition rates. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Planned Study Period: <\/span><span>The study will begin in May 2021 and data collection will take place across an estimated 6 month period.With 6 month and 12 month follow ups after the initial assessment interview.
