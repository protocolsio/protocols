The donor DNA contains gene-specific homology arms and an integral antibiotic-resistance gene that inserts at the double-stranded break generated by Cas9.  After optimizing multiple parameters of this method, we were able to generate mutants in six out of six different genes in two different cell-walled strains with mutation efficiencies ranging from 40% to 95%.  Furthermore, these high efficiencies allowed simultaneous targeting of two separate genes in a single experiment.
