Abnormal protein ubiquitination is closely related to the occurrence and development of many diseases. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of ubiquitination at the proteomic level helps to further understand the process of protein ubiquitination in organisms, and is important for understanding and treating various diseases caused by disorders of the ubiquitination system, especially malignant tumors. significance.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1606306079}
