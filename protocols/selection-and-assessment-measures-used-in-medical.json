class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Introduction<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Patterson et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review examining selection methods used in medical education. The researchers assessed the quality, along with the strengths and weaknesses, of common selection methods. The review evaluated the effectiveness of aptitude tests, academic records, personal statements, references, SJTS, personality and emotional intelligence assessments, interviews, MMIs and selection centres. <\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Since the publishing of Patterson et al.\u2019s review in 2015, a wealth of research has been completed on selection methods, including a number of longitudinal studies. The present systematic review aims to provide an updated analysis of the literature on the quality of selection methods in medical education. The current review will aim to overcome significant limitations present within the original review. The review will consider literature published from 2015 onwards, encompassing research that has so far not been included in a systematic review of this nature. Completing an updated review will allow medical education providers to understand how recent contributions to the literature may have changed our understanding of the quality of methods used. This will allow for a more comprehensive decision process of which selection methods should be used within medical education in the future.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conflicts of interest<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">There are no conflicts of interest to report.
