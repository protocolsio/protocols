class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Extraction of DNA, and especially RNA from soils, can be challenging due to the presence of organic impurities, which can inhibit downstream enzymatic reactions and the fact that many soil microorganisms are dormant or nearly inactive and hence hard to lyse. The following collection of protocols describe a robust and flexible pipeline for extracting high amounts of pure DNA and RNA from nearly all types of soils. The methods have been successfully tested for mineral and highly organic soils and soils with very low biomass. <\/div><br\/><\/div>","changed_on":1627387256}
