Amplicons from 1276 soil samples were randomly and equally distributed into 3 DNBSEQ runs for both 2\u00d7200 paired-end (PE200) and 400 bases single-end sequencing (SE400). The left libraries of total 1276 samples were repetitively sequenced two more times by SE400 using different DNBSEQ-G400 machines. Three randomly chosen soil samples from each forest plot (ALS268, LJ105 and NBH217) were all amplified 3 times separately as PCR replicates. The corresponding 9 sequencing libraries were sequenced repetitively by 3 DNBSEQ runs. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sequencing was carried out using the entire lane of the Illumina MiSeq platform in the University of Minnesota Genomic Center. Amplicons of the 1276 forest soil were normalized and pooled randomly in equal molar ratios into 8 parallel sequencing runs on MiSeq platform. Again, three randomly chosen soil samples from each forest plot (ALS268, LJ105 and NBH217) were all amplified 3 times separately as PCR replicates. The corresponding 9 sequencing libraries were sequenced repetitively by 8 MiSeq runs. <\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/cypjbgx9x.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1612491596}
