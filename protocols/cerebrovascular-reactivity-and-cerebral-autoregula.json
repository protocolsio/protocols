Both mechanisms are typically assessed in either the supine or seated postures, but the effects of body position and sex differences remain unclear. This study examined the effects of body posture (supine vs. seated vs. standing) on cerebrovascular reactivity during hyper and hypocapnia and on cerebral autoregulation during spontaneous and slow-paced breathing in healthy men and women using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography of the middle cerebral artery. Results indicated significantly improved cerebrovascular reactivity in the supine compared with seated and standing postures (supine= 3.45\u00b10.67, seated= 2.72\u00b10.53, standing= 2.91\u00b10.62%\/mmHg, <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">P<\/span><span><0.0167). Similarly, cerebral autoregulatory measures showed significant improvement in the supine posture during slow-paced breathing. Transfer function measures of gain were significantly decreased and phase significantly increased in the supine posture compared with seated and standing postures (gain: supine= 1.98\u00b10.56, seated= 2.37\u00b10.53, standing= 2.36\u00b10.71%\/mmHg; phase: supine= 59.3\u00b121.7, seated= 39.8\u00b112.5, standing= 36.5\u00b19.7\u00b0; all <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">P<\/span><span><0.0167).
