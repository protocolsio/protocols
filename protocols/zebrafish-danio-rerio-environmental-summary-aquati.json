These parameters are important and often overlooked sources of potential variation in experiments, and should be reported in peer-reviewed publications in order to promote scientific reproducibility.\u00a0 To that end, here we provide a summary of the environmental conditions\u00a0in zebrafish (Danio rerio) aquaculture facilities at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH).\u00a0 \u00a0We include data on the physico-chemical, health, and nutrition of zebrafish in three separate facilities at BCH: Karp, Enders SSB, and Enders Lobby. In this year's version, we also include new information on our feeding practices and colony pathogen history. This information will be applicable to any study involving zebrafish conducted in one of these three facilities during the year of 2020.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1610540622}
