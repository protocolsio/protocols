Exclusion criteria were: 1) Current substance use disorder of a substance other than nicotine or caffeine; 2) History of neurological or psychiatric disorders; 3) Any contraindication for electrical brain stimulation procedures (i.e. electronic implants or metal implants); 4) Pregnancy or breast-feeding; 5) Intentions to actively try to quit smoking in the next three months. Participants were recruited via advertisement at Erasmus University Rotterdam from October 2016 until March 2018 and received either course credit or a financial compensation of 20 euro<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The current study employed a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled design in which subjects received a total of six tDCS sessions (active or sham) on three days in one week with at least one day in between. Participants were first randomly assigned to either sham or active tDCS. Then, before the tDCS sessions and at three months follow-up, participants completed the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND; [28]). Breath carbon monoxide concentrations were also measured using a Micro+ Smokerlyzer (Bedfont Scientific Ltd., Rochester, UK) to objectively define smoking.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">To measure changes in smoking behaviour, participants were asked to keep track of their cigarette consumption, craving and affect in an application on their mobile phones (EMA). Questions in the application were presented at four random times a day for three weeks in total (random assessments; RA\u2019s), starting the week before the first tDCS session. After three months, participants were asked to fill out the same four-time daily random assessments for one more week. In addition, participants were asked to start a session every time they smoked a cigarette (user-initiated smoking assessment; SA) for three months in total. An \u2018end of the day\u2019 assessment (EA) was also implemented for three months, which asked participants to fill out the total number of smoked cigarettes of that day. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1590681994}
