Multivariable extension allows for correcting for confounders. In our case, lower gestational age and current weight have been associated both with birth weight and with decreased survival.

This phenomenon, referred to as confounding by indication, will be accounted for with propensity score matching (PSM). A further concern is the non-randomized design in all studies, implying residual confounding in other domains. The PSM approach also provides more reliable estimates in such settings. A logistic regression model will be fitted to calculate the predicted probability of a patient being allocated to compared groups, in our case PD duration less or more than 5 hours. Covariates upon which balance is sought will be age, birth weight and etiology (sepsis\/other). The output will be a matched in which primary and secondary outcome analyses will be repeated.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1596211276}
