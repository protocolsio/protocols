The CGenFF server (https:\/\/cgenff.umaryland.edu\/) provides topologies and parameters of ligands compatible with the CHARMM36 all-atoms force field. Protein and protein-ligand complexes were soaked in a cubic box of water molecules, and the charges on the protein were neutralized by the addition of Na<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;vertical-align:super;\">+<\/span><span> and Cl<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;vertical-align:super;\">-<\/span><span> ions. The energy of the system was minimised using the steepest descent algorithm to eliminate bad contact and clashes. The NVT and NPT ensembles were used during the equilibration to achieve the desired temperature (373.15 K for protease and 300 K for protease-ligand complex) and pressure (1 bar) for 100 ps and restraint forces of 1000 kJ\/mol. Finally, 40 ns MD run were performed in triplicate after releasing all restraints. All bonds were constrained by the LINCS algorithm.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1593014769}
