The needle-based in vivo delivery of transfection reagents can be invasive. Here, we report a non-invasive in vivo gene delivery protocol via the needle-free MED-JET H4 MULTIJET (MJH4M) devices using glucose-based and commercial transfection reagents. The objective of this study is to compare the relative transfection efficiencies of the needle-free system to that of the needle-based delivery method. The highest transfection efficiency was noted using 5% glucose as a delivery agent; a 15-fold increase was observed using MJH4M compared to delivery with needles.
