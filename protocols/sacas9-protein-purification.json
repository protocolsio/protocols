Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 200 \u00b5M and cells were grown overnight with vigorous shaking at 18\u00b0C. Following incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml \/ 100 mg cell weight of xTractor Buffer (Takara Bio) plus 5 mg of lysozyme. Cells were lysed by sonication, then 1 \u00b5l \/ 2ml of DNAse I was added. The soluble fraction was purified using the His60 Ni Superflow Resin & Gravity Columns (Takara Bio) following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. The concentration of SaCas9 containing fractions were determined by optical density at 280 nm and then pooled.
