That is, leaving aside the semi-quantitative scores based on scores that are given to the lesion in a tissue according to its degree of severity. The argument is that the final injury score will depend more on the subjectivity and experience of the observer.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">With the advent of digital images and programs for their analysis, the application of numerical methods for estimating changes in tissues was greatly facilitated. With them we do not completely suppress the observational, but, to a large extent and if we are rigorous, we can significantly reduce its influence. Thus, in two-dimensional images, we can make direct measurements such as the diameter and length of a gland, its surface, etc., always in previously calibrated systems. We can also estimate the dimensions of structures that are part of a tissue and the spatial relationships between them based on a two-dimensional image. In this case we will use stereology, which uses simple mathematical formulas, but is very time consuming for analysis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Now, structuralists have realized that the normal components of a tissue or a cell maintain certain spatial relationships and proportionality to each other, which also defines their shapes and textures (complexity), constituting the characteristic histological images of a kidney, liver, uterus, etc. Both the pathology and the functional adaptations alter these normal relationships, which wanted to be estimated through the application of the fractal dimension. The justification is that, when faced with a certain insult or stimulus, the tissue or organ responds \u201cin toto\u201d, not one part yes and another no. The single measurement of diameters, surfaces, etc., while complementary, was always thought to be incomplete because we were missing those changes in the relationships between tissue components or from one cell to another, which provide important additional information.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630731026}
