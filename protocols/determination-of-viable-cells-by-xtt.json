The colour change will only occur in the presence of these reagents and in living cells, so the amount of colour change can be used to quanitfy the amount of viable cells. The Beer-Lambert Law states that absorbance of a given wavelength will be proportional to concentration, and therefore the concentration of colour that is absorbed will be proportional to the number of viable cells.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1616436827}
