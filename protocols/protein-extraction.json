The cells were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet the cells. The cell pellet was sonicated at amplitude 30%, pulse 10 seconds, gap 10 seconds, for a total time of 2 minutes: 30 seconds or 15 Cycles to obtain the cell lysate. The TRIzol extraction protocol was used with minor modifications(24). In brief, to the cell lysate, 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and 200 \u00b5L of chloroform were added. The solution was mixed vigorously and was centrifuged 14,000g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The Upper clear phase was carefully decanted and to the remaining phase, 300 \u00b5L of ethanol was added and incubated at room temperature for 3 minutes followed by centrifugation at 2000g for 15 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. To the supernatant, a 4-fold volume of ice-cold acetone was added and kept for overnight incubation at -20\u00baC. The protein pellet was washed thrice first with 0.3 M Guanidium-HCl in 95 % ethanol followed by ice-cold acetone two times. All the protein pellets were air dried and wer subsequently dissolved in rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2 % CHAPS, Distilled water). Protein concentrations were estimated using Bradfor assay.<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1596655024}
