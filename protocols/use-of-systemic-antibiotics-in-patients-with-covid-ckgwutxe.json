The aim was to determine the pattern of use of systemic antibiotics in a group of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Colombia in the 2020-2022 period. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study designed to identify antibiotics prescription patterns for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 treated in 8 clinics in Colombia. The AWaRe tool of the World Health Organization (WHO) was used to classify the antibiotics. A total of 10,916 patients from 181 cities were included. The median age of the patients was 57 years, and 56.4% were men. A total of 29.7% of the patients required intensive care unit (ICU) care, and 20.2% required invasive mechanical ventilation. A total of 57.5% received antibiotics, especially ampicillin/sulbactam (58.8%) and clarithromycin (47.9%). Most of the antibiotics were classified as Watch (65.1%), followed by Access (32.6%) and Reserve (2.4%). Men (OR:1.29; 95% CI:1.17-1.43), older adults (OR:1.67; 95%CI:1.48-1.88), patients with dyspnea at admission (OR:1.26; 95%CI:1.13-1.41), rheumatoid arthritis (OR:1.94; 95%CI:1.17-3.20), and high blood pressure (OR:1.45; 95%CI: 1.29-1.63), patients treated in-hospital (OR:5.15; 95%CI: 4.59-5.77), patients admitted to the ICU (OR:10.48; 95%CI:8.82-12.45), patients treated with systemic glucocorticoids (OR:3.60; 95%CI:3.21-4.03) and vasopressors (OR:2.10; 95% CI: 1.60-2.75), and patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.82-3.09) were more likely to receive a systemic antibiotic.Most of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 received antibiotics despite evidence showing that bacterial coinfection is rare. Antibiotics from the Watch group predominated, a practice that goes against WHO recommendations.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"","document":"","documents":[{"id":0,"type_id":0,"filename":"","key":"","color":"","height":0,"width":0,"is_document":null,"original_file_id":null,"thumb_url":"https://www.protocols.io/img/extensions/xlsx.png","size":null,"is_private":0,"is_new":0,"ofn":"BD_COVID-19_antibiotics.xlsx","url":"https://content.protocols.io/files/j6cxbamqp.xlsx","bucket_name":null,"s3_webp_url":"","file_id":323669}],"doi":"dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.rm7vzbk5xvx1/v1","doi_status":1,"ethics_statement":null,"fork_id":null,"fork_info":null,"forks":[],"funders":[],"groups":[],"guid":"1AF218B07BC911EDB11F2F487432DE5C","guidelines":"","has_references":false,"has_step_reagents":false,"has_versions":false,"id":73974,"image":{"source":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_source":null,"placeholder":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_placeholder":null},"image_attribution":"","in_trash":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_contact_suspended":false,"is_content_confidential":false,"is_content_warning":false,"is_doi_reserved":true,"is_in_pending_publishing":false,"is_in_transfer":false,"is_owner":true,"is_research":true,"is_retracted":false,"is_shared_directly":false,"is_subprotocol":null,"is_unlisted":false,"item_id":1053286,"journal":null,"journals":[{"journal_id":"10.3390/antibiotics12020252","name":"Antibiotics","group_id":1,"link":"https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12020252","citation":"Valladales-Restrepo LF,  Delgado-Araujo AC,  Echeverri-Martínez LF,  Sánchez-Ríos V,  Machado-Alba JE, Use of Systemic Antibiotics in Patients with COVID-19 in Colombia: A Cross-Sectional Study.
