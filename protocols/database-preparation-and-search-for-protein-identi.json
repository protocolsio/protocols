mass-spec data were searched against the customized mosquito larvicidal toxin database which included well established larvicidal toxins like Cry1 to Cry73, Bin-A\/B, VIP-1\/2\/3\/4, and Mtx-1\/2\/3. (28). The default search parameters used for the analysis are as follows: (a) trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme with up to one missed cleavage; (b) peptide mass error tolerance of 20ppm; (c) fragment mass error tolerance of 0.1 Da; (d) carb-amido-methylation of cysteine as fixed modification (e) oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. A false discovery rate of 1% was applied while identifying the peptide-spectrum matches. Two criteria used to report a positive find, 1) reported protein\/toxin should have least two numbers of peptides in amino acid sequence; and 2) the length of each of the identified peptide sequences using LC-MS has a minimum of 10 amino acids.<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1596656246}
