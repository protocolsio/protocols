In this paper, we explore the decision to misrepresent one\u2019s self and subsequently determine whether honesty oaths impact truthful reporting of a personal characteristic. To do this, we execute a field experiment on Amazon MTurk using a self-reporting task involving worker eye color. We provide empirical evidence that honesty oaths elicit more truthful behavior, primarily impacting \u201cextreme\u201d lies. Oath-taking decreased the cost associated with misreporting personal characteristics by 70%.  Oaths marginally decrease shirking.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1595529131}
