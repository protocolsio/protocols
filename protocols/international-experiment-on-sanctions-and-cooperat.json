We follow relevant literature in responding to such issues (Roth et al. 1991; Hermann et al., 2008; Buchan et al., 2009; Georg et al., 2016)).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">It is well-known that personal differences between experimenters conducting research sessions may induce some differences in participants\u2019 behavior. Personal differences include personality or gestural differences, or other physiological differences in, for instance, voice pitch, intonation, and, of course, gender and age, which may ultimately elicit different responses by participants. These effects could not be eliminated, but we strived to minimize them.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Firstly, we produced an experimental script that provided a detailed description of the various stages of the experimental session and the instructions to be administered to participants (see the timeline of the experiment in Materials: Fig. 1). Each lead researcher (the authors of this paper) read the same instructions from this script in the session (see Experimenter script), thus ensuring that identical information was given in identical order and in identical format in all the research sessions. Some of these instructions involved PowerPoint\u00a9 presentations (see Materials: \u201cPowerpoint presentations\u201d for instruction summary and presentation of decisions stages), which were prepared using the same format for all locations. Since the sessions were run simultaneously, the duration of the various stages of the session had to be approximately the same. Research materials, such as the materials to run the final lottery draw, and the video cameras used for the video links (see next steps) were also the same in all locations.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Secondly, the lead researchers participated in two collective meetings before data collection, in which session procedures were discussed and agreed upon. In one meeting in Moscow, a mock experimental session was conducted by one lead researcher under the observation of all others, in order to make the conduction of the session as uniform as possible.\n\n<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1225133,"guid":"BCC148D0F2DD11EBABC7FF37EB4A8A9C","previous_id":1225132,"previous_guid":"6347DBC0F2DD11EBABC7FF37EB4A8A9C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6D74FF1FDF294A92B0D30FEF193E037F","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods to ensure between-country comparability of data"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"628B2972E890451A8E3409BB2035D103","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Since a word may have a different nuance, or additional meanings, when translated into another language, language effects may also pre-empt full comparability of international experimental data. Differences in syntactic rules across languages, and the fact that language expressions ultimately reflect different cultural norms in the way people address each other in different countries, may also introduce some subtle differences in the way people react to the same set of instructions in different languages. In fact, a significant foreign language effect in decision-making has been found(Costa et al., 2014). We followed what we believe is the best practice in cross-country and inter-country experimental research, as set out by Herrmann et al. (2008) and used the back-translation method to make instructions in Russian and German as comparable as possible. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">As none of the five authors is bilingual in German and Russian, we elaborated the master version of the instructions in English. Researchers from our team translated this version into their native language. We then asked a professional German-Russian translator to back-translate the Russian version of the instructions into German. This back-translated version was compared with the original German version. Every difference in the two versions was discussed among members of our team and the translator, and the original translations were then adapted to minimize differences in connotation. <\/div><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1225134,"guid":"DB0DC8E0F2DD11EBABC7FF37EB4A8A9C","previous_id":1225133,"previous_guid":"BCC148D0F2DD11EBABC7FF37EB4A8A9C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"71B5C0D085DE4C20867FB213415028A6","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods to ensure between-country comparability of data"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D76046EC24184730851CDC682C6930C1","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Another issue that could hinder comparability is the possibility that the monetary incentives used in different locations were different from each other. We followed standard practice in experimental economics, and formulated instructions referring to \u2018tokens\u2019 rather than to national monetary units. Adjusting the monetary value of a token using the official exchange rate between two currencies is not sufficient, because differences in general price levels between the two countries will alter the purchasing power of a currency when exchanged into another currency. Given that official statistics of Purchasing Power Parity are published with a delay of some years on current prices, we used the standard hourly pay rate for student assistants at universities in each country as the conversion factor to ensure that the monetary value of a token had the same purchasing power in each location. This method is appropriate for university students.

In these studies, the unit of observation is a group of participants, and each group comprises 6-10 participants (we chose the lower bound of 6 for our experiment). These studies had 10 groups per treatment and found a very large effect size for their treatments. In particular, the size of the effect of introducing uncertainty over the safety threshold in Barrett and Dannenberg (2012)was Cohen\u2019s d=3.59 {m1 =150.9, m2 =79.9, sd1 =7.69, sd2 =26.90}. We were skeptical that in the context of our study, in which the main treatment concerns the variation in cooperation in an international environment vis-\u00e0-vis a national one, the effect size would have been as large. Therefore, we decided to increase sample size to N=16 per treatment. Ex post power analysis confirmed that our prediction was correct. The sample size requested for Type-1 error = 0.05 ad for Power = 0.80 to detect a significant difference in the means observed in one of our key treatments (the difference of cooperation in the International Open treatment and the National Russian treatment under sanctions, where {m1 =22.4375, m2 =28.7875, sd1 =6.9067, sd2 =4.6133}) is N=15, which is very close to our choice of N=16.

Since we wanted to achieve a fully balanced sample across treatments, we did not randomize a treatment for each session, but rather we followed a pre-fixed sequence that alternated treatments. The treatment sequence had to take into account various constraints. One constraint was that our International \u201cBlind\u201d treatments (where participants were not informed that they were interacting with people from another country) had to be conducted before the International \u201cOpen\u201d treatments. Had we done differently, \u201ccontagion\u201d effects across participants from different sessions may have affected the internal validity of the Blind treatments, because some students may have inferred that other participants were from another country. Our strategy was overall successful because most participants revealed that they expected the other laboratory to be located within their country in the Blind treatments. Other constraints had to do with the university academic calendars, as students were not present on campus out of term. We balanced the assignment of treatments to starting times, to avoid that, say, all sessions belonging to one treatment were run in the morning, while all sessions relative to another treatment were run in the afternoon. This aspect of the design should prevent that treatment effects were confounded with self-selection into particular times of the day.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1225160,"guid":"D896EF20F32211EBABC7FF37EB4A8A9C","previous_id":1225159,"previous_guid":"C2496680F32211EBABC7FF37EB4A8A9C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"174E23ECE6224F5EBE32606AFBC32C22","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Experiment procedures"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"B5FABD4A515240F9B420FDFB03168832","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">32 sessions were conducted between <\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">November 2016 and February 2017.

The connection was realized through Z-Tree. Each research session comprised 24 participants, who were randomly allocated to four groups, whose members were three from one laboratory and three from the other. After receiving instructions and passing a comprehension test, participants interacted over ten rounds. Each participant had a fixed allocation of money in each round, which could have been kept for oneself or contributed to a group account. Contributions decreased the probability that every group member would suffer a 75% loss in their personal account at the end of the interaction. A random draw determined whether the loss event occurred, and individual payoffs were paid privately in cash at the end of the session. Each session was run under one of eight treatments, where (a) the group partners were either from the same country or from different countries, (b) information on the other group's nationality was either revealed or not, (c) sanctioning others in the group was either possible or not.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1627862575}
