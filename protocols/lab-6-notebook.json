protocols to prepare a sample into what is known as a DNA library for sequencing on the nanopore. For this class, we will use the RAD-004 protocol. This protocol utilizes transposases to fragment the DNA and attach transposase adapters to each DNA fragment. Once the transposase complex is broken, rapid sequence adapters are added to the ends of the transpose adapters. The simplicity and \u201ctwo-step\u201d process is best utilized for those in situations where users desire a fast and simple library preparation time and lack access to ideal lab equipment. Since we will be sequencing in a DIY lab, this is the most ideal approach we can take.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Is DNA sequenced in a single strand or in a duplex?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What\u2019s responsible for pulling the DNA through the pore?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What is the significance of the transposase complex?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">How is the sequencing information interpreted by the MinKNOW software?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Draw a picture of how you think Nanopore sequencing works and write 2-3 sentences explaining it. <\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">This is a list of all the reagents that come with the RAD-004 kit as well as a description of what they do to help with the library preparation and loading process.<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Lab Results<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What protein is this?
