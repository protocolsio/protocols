If the tissue section is in a clear bottom plate, position the plate over a sheet of paper with some text. ideally, the text will be perfectly readable through the tissue with little to no distortion. This serves as a good quick determination of the clearing quality. The true test is the quality of imaging with confocal or multiphoton microscopy in terms of imaging depth and clarity.<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/c79bf9a5b7487f0f01a6aca0893b1ac173ba65109e465269be4d07b10b2af16a\/cgn28ain.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"18885D73B5EB4906BAF830F3566ED711","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/c79bf9a5b7487f0f01a6aca0893b1ac173ba65109e465269be4d07b10b2af16a\/cgn28ain.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[{"id":336693,"mol_weight":0,"name":"N-butyldiethanolamine","linfor":"","url":"https:\/\/www.tcichemicals.com\/eshop\/en\/us\/commodity\/B0725\/","sku":"B0725","cas_number":"102-79-4","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"TCI Chemicals","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"note":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.tcichemicals.com\/en\/us\/index.html","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":450},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}},{"id":336694,"mol_weight":0,"name":"N-methylnicotinamide","linfor":"","url":"https:\/\/www.tcichemicals.com\/eshop\/en\/us\/commodity\/M0374\/","sku":"M0374","cas_number":"114-33-0","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"TCI Chemicals","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"note":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.tcichemicals.com\/en\/us\/index.html","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":450},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}},{"id":350441,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Antipyrine","linfor":"","url":null,"sku":"104971000","cas_number":"60-80-0","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Acros Organics","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"note":null,"link":"http:\/\/www.acros.com\/","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":117},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}},{"id":350445,"mol_weight":0,"name":"Triton X-100","linfor":"","url":null,"sku":"X100-100ML","cas_number":"9002-93-1","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Sigma Aldrich","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"note":null,"link":"http:\/\/sigmaaldrich.com","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":17},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}},{"id":350447,"mol_weight":0,"name":"10X Phosphate Buffered Saline","linfor":"","url":null,"sku":"46013CM","cas_number":"","rrid":"","public":0,"vendor":{"name":"Corning","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":null,"note":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.corning.com\/worldwide\/en.html","image":{"source":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png","placeholder":"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/img\/vendors\/placeholder.png"},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false,"id":40},"can_edit":0,"stats":{"total_protocols":0}}],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Purpose and Scope of the Procedure:  <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Provide a relatively rapid clearing of lung tissue sections up to 1 millimeter thick for immunofluorescence staining and imaging with confocal or multiphoton microscopy.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Current protocol is limited to tissue sections that are free from severe hemorrhage\/thrombosis, containing mostly parenchyma, vessels, and smaller bronchioles. Times and solution volumes may need to be altered slightly if one wishes to clear sections containing a lot of cartilage and\/or blood.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Scientific Principles: <\/span><span>One of the major challenges in conventional brightfield, epifluorescence, and even confocal microscopy is the limitation in imaging depth. This is primarily due to the scattering and absorption of light within the sample of both the excitation light and the emission light leading to a drastic reduction in the image brightness and contrast when deeper than a 100\u00b5m. Clearing offers a way around this by both reducing the components that negatively impact the light and by matching the refractive index of the mounting medium to that of the components which make up the tissue, leading to an almost transparent appearance.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol is a slight modification of a Clear Unobstructed Brain\/Body Imaging Cocktail (CUBIC) protocol described by Kubota et al. developed originally to allow the analysis of cancer metastasis within the bodies of entire mice. By taking advantage of the fact lung tissue has plenty of open spaces and a very large surface area we can reduce the time in each of the solutions to allow complete clearing of the tissue sections to within just a few days.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">References:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u00b7Light Microscopy Methods and Protocols (2017). p. 74<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u00b7Kubota et al., (2017).
