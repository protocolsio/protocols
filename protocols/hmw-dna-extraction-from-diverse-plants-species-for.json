Therefore modifications (mainly\/mostly BME addition during the lysis step and a Phenol:Chloroform purification step) were made to create a new version of this protocol. This new version allowed to successfully extract DNA from orchid samples. This DNA was then sequenced on a Nanopore PromethION platform and good results in term of total yield and read length were obtained. This protocol was also successfully applied to a wide range of plant species (See attached document\/excel sheet).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Sequencing of the <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Arabidopsis thaliana<\/span><span> samples listed in the attached reports was performed in collaboration with the GeT core facility, Toulouse, France (<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/get.genotoul.fr)\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">http:\/\/get.genotoul.fr)<\/span><\/a><span>,  and was supported by France G\u00e9nomique National infrastructure, funded  as part of \u201cInvestissement d\u2019avenir\u201d program managed by Agence Nationale  pour la Recherche (contract ANR-10-INBS-09).
