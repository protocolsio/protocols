Both these methods require specific swabs that are in short supply, and both methods are not easily self-administered. A nasal swab can also be used to collect samples and is relatively easy to self-administer, yet obtaining nasal specific swabs can now also be a challenge. In order to address these issues, our group has optimized a protocol for self-administered nasal collection using buccal swabs that are not currently in high demand. With this method, we have been able to collect human samples with reliable results in RNA extraction based on RNaseP, and can detect SARS-Cov2 in known positive cases of COVID-19. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1587416652}
