A signal activates the GTPase, which then binds to an effector molecule to relay a signal inside the cell. The GTPase effector trap flow cytometry assay (G-Trap) utilizes bead-based protein immobilization and dual-color flow cytometry to rapidly and quantitatively measure GTPase activity status in cell or tissue lysates. Beginning with commercial cytoplex bead sets that are color-coded with graded fluorescence intensities of a red (700\u00a0nm) wavelength, the bead sets are derivatized to display glutathione on the surface through a detailed protocol described here. A different glutathione-<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S<\/span><span>-transferase-effector protein (GST-effector protein) can then be\u00a0attached to the surface of each set. For the assay, users can incubate bead sets individually or in a multiplex format with lysates for rapid, selective capture of active, GTP-bound GTPases from a single sample. After that, flow cytometry is used to identify the bead-borne\u00a0GTPase based on red bead intensity, and the amount of active GTPase per bead is detected using monoclonal antibodies conjugated to a green fluorophore or via labeled secondary antibodies. Three examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the effector-functionalized beads for measuring the activation of at least five GTPases in a single lysate from fewer than 50,000 cells.<\/span><\/div><br\/><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Section 3.2 'Production of a Cleared Cell Lysate' from 'Small-Volume Flow Cytometry-Based Multiplex Analysis of the Activity of Small GTPases' <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/small-volume-flow-cytometry-based-multiplex-analys-bpssmnee\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/small-volume-flow-cytometry-based-multiplex-analys-bpssmnee<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617662}
