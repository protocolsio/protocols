As with all animal models, husbandry conditions, including environmental parameters, nutrition, and exposure to pathogens can affect research results. Additionly, zebrafish are tolerant of a wide range of environmental parameters, which has led to wide variation in husbandry practices across facilities around the world. The lack of standard conditions across zebrafish laboratories may play a role in irreproducible experiments. Therefore, annual summaries of these conditions have been compiled for the Zebrafish Aquaculture Core (ZAC) facility at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill with the aim to have this data included in research articles published using our fish. As more institutions publish husbandry protocols, standard husbandry practices may emerge.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1591130817}
