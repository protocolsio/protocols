Following the biopsychosocial model of health, the goal of the current study was to predict people\u2019s psychological well-being (PWB) during the initial lockdown phase of the pandemic and to investigate which coping strategies were most common among people with low and high PWB. Participants were 938 volunteers in the United States who responded to an online survey during pre-peak April 2020. The main findings were that all three groups of variables, biological, psychological, and socio-economic, significantly contributed to PWB explaining 53% variance, with social loneliness and sense of agency being the strongest predictors. PWB was significantly predicted by physical health (not gender nor age); by spirituality, emotional loneliness, and sense of agency; by social loneliness, and employment security (not income, nor neighborhood safety, nor hrs. spent on social media). Comparing the coping strategies of participants, results show more intentional coping in the high-PWB group and more passive coping in the low-PWB group. With this unprecedented pandemic, the findings highlight that actively and intentionally attending to one\u2019s PWB by using strategies that own one\u2019s control and being an agent for physical, spiritual health, and social connection, may pose greater sustainability in the course of this global shift. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1615910761}
