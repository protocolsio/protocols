Any individuals that did not exhibit continuous flight behavior at least within the last 10 minutes of its 30 minute testing phase were pulled off the flight mill and replaced with a new bug and its accompanying ID in an event marker comment.

An individual that strictly exhibited continuous flight flew uninterrupted for 10 minutes or more at least by the end of its 30 minute testing phase (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 7A<\/span><span>).

Likewise, there is a strong incentive for researchers to adapt to fast-emerging technologies and techniques from industry and other scientific fields to design and build experimental tools to study ecological systems<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">9,23-24<\/span><span>. This protocol takes advantage of two rapidly emerging technologies, the 3D printer and the laser cutter, which are becoming increasingly available in communal makerspaces, in order to enhance the simple, modern flight mill. These enhancements provide a more flexible, adjustable, and collapsible design that accommodates insects of different sizes, minimizes stress placed on the insect, and allows the flight mill to be transported easily to multiple locations or environments. Furthermore, the additional expenses of using the technologies are minimal or even free. However, these technologies can also be a challenge to experiment with if their accessibility or reaching proficiency in using vector graphics editors and 3D image software is not readily available. In turn, the flight mill presented here serves to both encourage researches to incorporate available emerging technologies in their workflow and allow researchers to build a customizable, flexible, and effective flight mill without specialized knowledge of electronics, programming, or computer aided design (CAD) models.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The strongest aspects of this protocol are the makerspace\u2019s technologies that expand a user\u2019s flight mill design options, the use of magnetic paint to minimize insect stress, and the automation of flight recordings followed by the processing of multiple insects within a single recording. The laser cutter offers precise and exact cutting capabilities that can handle jobs of almost any complexity. The user can modify the acrylic support structure to mount additional 3D prints or purchased items. The 3D printer allows the user to create customizable flight mill components that can bypass costly, pre-made products with narrowly adjustable dimensions. Finally, the use of automated recording software and Python scripts to differentiate multiple flight trials within a single recording makes it possible to study sporadic bouts of flight to very long bouts of flight. However, given how variable flight activity and duration is across species, it is suggested that the user conducts preliminary trials in order to understand the limits and general patterns of a species\u2019 flight behavior so as to optimize data collection. The user can also assess the integrity of their recordings using the diagnostic graphic output and can account for any necessary speed corrections in the scripts.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Researchers should also be aware of the flight mill\u2019s general constraints. Previous studies have made known and have attempted to remediate the limitations of tethered flight including a lack of tarsal contact to allow the insect to rest at will<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">15,22<\/span><span>, the absence of energy expended when an insect takes-off<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">25<\/span><span>, the additional drag the insect overcomes when pushing the flight mill arm, and the insect needing to compensate for the outward aerodynamic forces experienced due to the centrifugal acceleration of its circular flight track<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">6,26<\/span><span>. Additionally, there continues to be inconsistencies on how to categorize or more precisely quantify the short or \u2018trivial\u2019 bursts insects display, especially when considering the flight behavior and mechanisms of large migratory insects to those of small insects who exhibit mostly hovering flight<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">21,27-28<\/span><span>. Despite these limitations, there has been significant progress in capturing and categorizing flight behavior within insect species and researchers have continued to couple the flight mill with other technologies and methods<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">6-8<\/span><span>.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Flight mills have played an important role in enabling researchers to understand the dispersal of insects \u2013 an ecological phenomenon still essentially intractable in the field. Future advances in the design and application of the flight mill can be achieved as researchers become more proficient in emerging technologies and the software accompanying those technologies. This could include designing flight mill arm bearings that allow vertical lift or gives the insect greater flight orientation flexibility. Additionally, the precision of laser cutters and 3D printers may be necessary for researchers interested in scaling down and calibrating for small insects with mostly hovering capabilities. In turn, the goal of this protocol was to provide an easy entry to these technologies while constructing one of the most common and useful devices in the field of behavioral ecology \u2013 the flight mill. If researchers have access to a communal makerspace and are committed to navigating its technologies, the resulting enhancements and improvements of the modern flight mill will lead to creative and collaborative flight mill design and will continue to offer insights into the underlying traits and mechanisms that influence insect species\u2019 variations and patterns in movement.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1051611,"guid":"A3D8DE100E3011EB813F978E11BAD0D6","previous_id":1052813,"previous_guid":"281B31C00F6011EB91D8371A623F0C85","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"1630978F052A4C70AC1105738D42161B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"740B52908E1D459A972DF3EAAA64E226","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References<\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span>Krogh, A., Weis-Fogh T.

This protocol demonstrates how to take advantage of the technology increasingly found in makerspaces in order to build a more versatile flight mill for a relatively low cost. Since this flight mill and trial design initially extracts its prototype from flight mills built in the last decade, this protocol instead focuses more on outlining divergences made from the simple, modern flight mill. As already shown, previous studies have made known how advantageous flight mills are to measuring flight parameters such as speed, distance, or periodicity and to allowing researchers to associate these parameters with morphological, physiological, or genetic factors. In addition to these advantages, I discuss the benefits of using the technology in makerspaces like 3D printers and laser cutters in order to build a more flexible, sturdy, and collapsible flight mill design. Most notably, the 3D printed components of this design allow the user to adjust the mill arm and IR sensor heights to test insects of various sizes and enable the user to easily disassemble the machine for quick storage or transportation to the field. Moreover, I emphasize making greater use of magnets and magnetic paint to attach insects with minimal stress during flight trials. Lastly, this protocol details a versatile analysis of flight data by programming how to efficiently take and process continuous but differentiable flight trials. Although more labor-intensive, communally-shared makerspaces and free, online 3D modeling programs can help researchers avoid costly, pre-made products with narrowly adjustable dimensions. By taking advantage of the flexibility and reproducibility of technology in makerspaces, this protocol promotes creative flight mill design and inspires open science.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1602819541}
