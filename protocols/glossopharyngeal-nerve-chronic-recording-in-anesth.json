Prior to surgery, all surgical instruments and implant assemblies were autoclave sterilized at 250\u2009\u00b0C for 1\u2009hour. During surgery, the animals were gas anesthetized under 2% isoflurane in 1\u2009L\/min oxygen. For each of the nerves, a section approximately 3\u20134 mm was completely separated from and devoid of all connective tissue. A custom made hook  was attached to a three-axis micromanipulator and positioned to provide a small amount of tension and suspend the nerve in the air. The slip knot was then removed, thereby releasing the silicone tube junction from the microneedle. The CNT yarn electrode assembly was then advanced into the nerve until all of the uninsulated CNT yarn segment was within the perineurium. Micro tweezers were then used to apply a small amount of pressure at the implant site while the Tungsten mirconeedle was carefully removed leaving the CNT yarn inside the nerve. The hook was then advanced along the nerve to the next implant site, approximately 2 mm away, and the implant process was repeated. The CNT yarns and the silicone tube junctions were then carefully positioned within the incision site and completely encapsulated with 1\u2009mL of fibrin glue (Tisseel, Baxter International Inc.)  to secure the implant in place while the normal physiological process of collagen encapsulation took place while the fibrin glue was absorbed by the body.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":708974,"guid":"AA735B00314211E9905DB5B362894083","previous_id":708973,"previous_guid":"AA7333F0314211E9905DB5B362894083","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"111E24CF9F5A41429DC151B68319E215","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F3CBAA50F9BD4AF59D1132AEFAF211BA","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The free DFT\u00ae wire ends are then tunneled and externalized at a location on the back between the shoulder blades.

class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">We propose to develop a neural interface based on carbon nanotube (CNT) yarns with a size similar to large axons (10 \u00b5m) that has a mechanical and molecular compatibility with the nerve. The mechanical properties of the interface will be optimized by matching flexural rigidity of the implant to that of the glossopharyngeal nerve (GLN). Since the wire is very flexible, a custom-inserting technique has been developed for this purpose and tested in rats.\u00a0 Following insertion, the signal-to-noise ratio and impedance of the wires will be measured for 3 months. The biocompatibility of the implant will be assessed using histological techniques.    <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1615557189}
