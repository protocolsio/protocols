As amphoteric electrolyte, proteins\u2019\u00a0isoelectric points are related to the ratio of acidic and basic amino acids it contains. Due to different amino acid residues, different proteins have different isoelectric points. When the positive and negative charges of a protein are exactly equal at a certain particular pH value, the protein does not move towards either the anode or the cathode in the electric field. Therefore, the isoelectric point of proteins can be determined by electrophoresis, and by which protein molecules with different charged properties, sizes and shapes can also be separated and purified.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1608295787}
