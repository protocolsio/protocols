PicoPure Extraction Kit: First, we used the PicoPure extraction kit by Applied Biosystems by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), using a 1:1 ratio of extraction buffer (guanidine isothiocianate) to 70% ethanol. We included DNase treatment by incubating extracted RNA with RNase-free DNase reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) for 15 min. Subsequently, to obtain better RNA quality compared to previous reports (e.g., mean RIN of 5.8) [13], we added a purification step using the <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qiagen.com\/us\/shop\/pcr\/rneasy-plus-mini-kit\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">RNeasy Mini Clean-up kit<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), which allows the concentration of at least <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> of total RNA (\u2265200 nucleotides) in an elution volume of 30\u2013100 \u00b5L. We performed this process on islets extracted from 7 non-diabetic PP samples and 2 diabetic PP samples.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">To improve both the quantity and the quality of the RNA, we first performed RNA extraction on LCM-collected islets from one non-diabetic and one diabetic subject using Qiazol reagent as lysis cell buffer, which has been reported to produce high-quality RNA from rat pancreas [16].

Total RNA was precipitated in a gel-like pellet on the sides and bottom of the tube by mixing the aqueous phase with <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> of isopropyl alcohol. To avoid DNA contamination, we incubated the extracted material for 15 min with RNase-free DNase reagent (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA). Two washing steps with ethanol were performed to remove contamination, and the extracted RNA was dissolved in <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> of DEPC-treated water for downstream analysis.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">3.

The final RNA was dissolved in <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> of DEPC-treated water.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">4. Microkit\/Carrier: In this protocol, we used Qiazol as lysis cell buffer and performed RNA extraction using the RNeasy Microkit 50 (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA, <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.qiagen.com\/us\/shop\/pcr\/rneasy-micro-kit\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Cat# 740049<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">).

Our results suggest that the Microkit\/Carrier protocol results in improved RNA quality from islets collected by LCM from both non-diabetic as well as diabetic subjects. All experiments were performed on freshly isolated pancreas samples from living patients undergoing partial pancreatectomy. These are extremely valuable tissues, and we believe that pancreatic surgery provides a rare opportunity to correlate in vivo endocrine and metabolic pathways (before surgery) with ex vivo data generated after collecting the pancreatic samples [16].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Previous reports on cell culture and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have reported that silica gel column technology using the RNeasy Mini-\/Microkit is superior in its ability to extract high-quality RNA compared to protocols using the traditional guanidine isothiocyanate extraction method [17], which is mostly explained by the high binding power of silica gel columns. There also appears to be a different outcome in terms of RNA quantity and quality between the two methods. For example, while the guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) technique yields a higher amount of RNA compared to the approach with the silica gel column (SGC), the RNA integrity of fresh as well as frozen samples of lung tissue appears to be improved with the latter method [18]. This relative loss of RNA quantity with the SGC technique could be related to the use of columns holding RNA molecules that are only ~200 nt. The loss of long non-coding RNA (more than 200 nt) by using the Microkit method could represent a disadvantage by limiting important insights into molecular functions provided by large-scale sequencing studies [19].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Despite some limitations, such as the tedious nature of the process and costs, laser capture microdissection (LCM) has several advantages, e.g., minimizing contamination from neighboring cells and avoiding changes due to hypoxia-induced stress that occurs during the normal islet isolation process. Therefore, LCM remains a suitable approach to extract RNA\/protein for studies aimed at gene and protein expression in targeted cells. Furthermore, the LCM technique guarantees isolation of high-quality RNA from specific cells from frozen samples. This is especially important when considering formalin-fixed tissues that typically provide low yields and poor quality of extractable DNA and RNA [20], in part due to formalin-induced modifications of the structure and chemistry of nucleic acids, particularly RNA [21].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Gene and protein expression using DNA microarrays, high-throughput sequencing, or proteomics analyses comparing various physiological or experimental conditions represents an essential tool in diverse biological fields to decipher mechanisms and to identify novel signaling pathways. In the islet biology field, RNA sequencing technologies have a high likelihood of identifying novel islet cell-specific promoters or splice forms as well as long non-coding RNAs, which cannot be detected by array analysis. Successful next-generation sequencing analyses require RNA samples free of contamination and degradation, easily obtained for sundry tissues using conventional protocols for RNA preparation. However, RNA isolation from pancreas samples continues to represent a challenge, given the high levels of endogenous RNases, DNases, and proteases that can quickly induce cell autolysis upon dissection. Consequently, classical RNA extraction protocols based on the phenol guanidine thiocyanate method yield RNAs of insufficient quality for subsequent sequencing analysis. In a published protocol for LCM of human islets from surgical specimens, the mean value of the RNA integrity number obtained was 5.8 [13], while in a more recent study, the authors reported an RNA integrity number mean value of 6 for human pancreatic islets derived from healthy brain-dead donors after adding an RNase inhibitor [12].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">In our experience, Nanodrop results showed no correlation with effective RNA purity, and we emphasize the importance of bioanalyzer assays to reliably evaluate the yield and quality of RNA. Indeed, it is known that 260\/280 absorbance could be affected by variables such as pH, phenol or alcohol contamination, or the presence of proteins [22,23]. Moreover, by analyzing surgical samples obtained from live subjects [24,25,26], instead of brain-dead donors, we minimized the interference from the effects of ischemia and the activation of subsequent inflammatory processes on gene expression [27,28].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Unlike previous studies wherein gene expression is evaluated in beta cell samples enriched by cell fluorescence, our approach used RNA from beta cells that continue to be in the islet microenvironment until extraction and therefore reflects interactions between the different endocrine cell types that is lacking in the former method.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">In summary, our comparative studies indicate that the Microkit\/Carrier protocol provides a relatively better yield in both the quality and the quantity of RNA extracted from human pancreatic samples compared to the other methods, and we propose this approach for studying differences in gene expression between groups.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The isolation of high-quality RNA from endocrine pancreas sections represents a considerable<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">challenge largely due to the high ribonuclease levels.
