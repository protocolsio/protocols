Experts agree that diet is somehow compromising reproduction, and this study will investigate dietary estrogenicity. Many plants produce chemicals known as phytoestrogens that activate estrogen receptors. The phytoestrogen-fertility relationship is well-documented in livestock, rhinoceroses, cheetahs, and pandas, and this study will characterize the pattern in slow lorises. We will adapt existing biomedical methods to investigate dietary estrogens and reproductive outcomes in captive pygmy slow lorises. Gene expression profiles will serve as proxies for in vivo estrogen receptor activity, and our heterologous cell-based receptor reporter assay will quantify in vitro estrogen receptor activation. Generalized linear mixed-effects models will integrate these parameters with reproductive outcomes to test the effect of gene expression profiles and diet estrogenicity on fertility. This long-term project will ultimately provide one of the first deep physiological examinations of phytoestrogen\u2019s proximate and ultimate influences on primate reproduction.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1621622678}
