The evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak with respect to the transmission in the mutational hotspots was assessed and evaluated on the GISAID web interface (https:\/\/www.epicov.org\/epi3\/frontend). Recurrent mutations observed were focused on as they are likely to confer viral-host structure-function relationship promoting higher transmission rate.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Determination of Testing, Fatality and Recovery Rate <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The testing rate was determined for each African country as a percentage of the total test done from the country\u2019s population.
