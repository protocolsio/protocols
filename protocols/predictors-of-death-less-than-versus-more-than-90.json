Heparin was administered in a dose of 100 units per kilogram in all children before shunt placement. Shunt size selection was based on the basis of body weight, size of pulmonary artery to be shunted and surgeon preference. After the operation, inotropic support (norepinephrine or epinephrine0.05-0.1 mcg\/kg\/min)was commenced intraoperatively and continued through the postoperative period to maintain adequate blood pressure to promote shunt flow.

Patient-related factors included age, weight at surgery, premature birth(gestational age <37 weeks), cardiac diagnosis(categorized as single ventricle, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD), tetralogy of fallot (TOF) and others), presentation of noncardiac abnormality(categorized as a syndrome such as heterotaxy, dextrocardia, or chronic lung disease),history of receiving a previous MBTSand preoperative inotropic drug use and ventilator support. The cardiac diagnoses of a single ventricle were pulmonary atresia, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS), tricuspid atresia, double inlet left ventricle, double outlet right ventricle,and complete atrioventricular canal defect with pulmonary atresia. Other complex cardiac diseases includedtransposition of great arteries (TGA), total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Anesthesia-related factors included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification(2-4), intraoperative inotropic drug use, intraoperative cardiac failure (requiring at least 2 inotropic drugs), intraoperative hemodilution (requiring phlebotomy to keep hematocrit <60% before surgery), intraoperative hypoxemia (SpO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2<\/span><span><75%), intraoperative hypoxic spell (acute hypoxemia with response to fluid and sodium bicarbonate administration) and bradycardia (heart rate below baseline by child\u2019s age with required atropine).

Shunt thrombosis was defined as loss of shunt murmur combined with no shunt flow diagnosed by echocardiography. Pneumothorax was defined as abnormal collection of air into the pleural space diagnosed by chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan. Perigraft seroma was defined as collection around prosthesis diagnosed by a pediatric cardiologist.Chylothorax was defined as the presence of chylein the pleural spaces.Sepsis was diagnosed as presumed or proven infection with systemic inflammation. Renal failure was diagnosed as a doubling of baseline serum creatinine level as recorded on admission to PICU.Total number of MBTS operations and other surgeries related to MBTS was defined as the total number of MBTS operations that the patient received previously and currently including shunt revision and reoperative thoracotomy related to complications (hemothorax, chylothorax, diaphragmatic plication) after MBTS in all admissions.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Outcomes of interest<\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Outcomes of interest weretime-to-deathdefined as the time from postoperative MBTS to death \u226490 days and >90 days.
