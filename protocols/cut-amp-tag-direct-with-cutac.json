\"text-block\"><span>We previously introduced Cleavage Under Targets & Tagmentation (CUT&Tag), an epigenomic profiling method in which antibody tethering of the Tn5 transposase to a chromatin epitope of interest maps specific chromatin features in small samples and single cells.With CUT&Tag, intact cells or nuclei are permeabilized, followed by successive addition of a primary antibody, a secondary antibody, and a chimeric Protein A-Transposase fusion protein that binds to the antibody. Addition of Mg++ activates the transposase and inserts sequencing adapters into adjacent DNA<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">in situ<\/span><span>.We have since adapted CUT&Tag to also map chromatin accessibility by simply modifying thetransposaseactivation conditions when using histone H3K4me2, H3K4me3 or Serine-5-phosphorylated RNA Polymerase II antibodies. Using these antibodies, tagmentation of accessible DNA sites is redirected to produce chromatin accessibility maps with exceptionally high signal-to-noise and resolution. All steps from nuclei to amplified sequencing-ready libraries are performed in single PCR tubeswith non-toxic reagents using inexpensive equipment, making our simplified strategy for simultaneous chromatin profiling and accessibility mapping suitable for the lab, home workbench or classroom. <\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1622932559}
