This method is meant to be very similar to methods commonly used in infant labs. We use Zoom (to meet with parents) and youtube for displaying videos, but there are other options (e.g., Slides.com for displaying videos). This method does not employ any habituation techniques or infant-controlled stimulus presentation: All participants see the same number of familiarization videos and test videos. The test videos are also a set length because we measure where on the screen the infants are looking. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1632754880}
