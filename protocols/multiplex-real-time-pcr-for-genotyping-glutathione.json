Therefore, each amplified sequence is characterized by the melting temperature (Tm) which varies depending on the length and sequence bases of the amplified product. Tm represents the temperature at which half of the target DNA is duplicated and the other half is dissociated, generating a fluorescence decay curve called melting curve [7].The programming performed for the melting curve was: 95 \u00b0C for 10 s, 65 \u00b0C for 1 min and increase to 95 \u00b0C, with 5 acquisitions per \u00b0C.

The expression of GSTs enzymes is mainly affected by the genetic polymorphisms. Polymorphic variants in the GSTM1 (GSTM1*0) and GSTT1 (GSTT1*0) genes produce either a functional proteins, i.e. non null phenotypes (non-deletion alleles or heterozygous deletion) or result in the complete absence of enzymes, i.e. null phenotypes (homozygous deletion or null genotype) [2].<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The homozygous deletions in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes are associated with reduced detoxification function and increased susceptibility to oxidative damage, due the absence of the enzymatic activity of these two isoforms.
