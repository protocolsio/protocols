Africa (SSA) is the region in the world with the highest number of individuals with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D), who are thus at very high risk of developing multiple chronic complications due to low awareness and lack of management of the condition [1, 2]. Nigeria, the most populous of African countries is the third largest country in SSA with people suffering from T2D [3]. Incidence and prevalence of CVD is still unclear in Nigeria. Reports from hospitalised patients and archived death records show a younger age of onset [4, 5], implicating huge co-morbidity of hyperglycaemia, with other CVD risk factors as contributors to the epidemiological transition.\\nIn 2015, there were more than 1.56 million cases of diabetes in Nigeria [3]. The only national survey over two decades ago reported 2.8% (95% CI 2.6 â 3.1%) prevalence of diabetes [6]. However, recent population-based cross-sectional observational studies report between 3.3 â 8.4% prevalence of T2D [7-9]. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) exist in greater proportions in concurrence with other CVD risk factors more than that identified in overt T2D populations [10, 11]. \\nLifestyle modification intervention studies or programs in the management of T2D and CVD in the dynamic Nigerian population is limited. Health services for prevention have been mainly provided by medical screening outreaches organized by researchers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), while treatment is largely inadequate due to expensive healthcare services and focus on management of overt conditions. This stretches the fragile health systems which has been overrun by high prevalent morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. The benefits of lifestyle modification programs have been established in studies elsewhere [12, 13], and its level of efficacy in preventing T2D and CVD can last up to 14 years after termination of lifestyle modification [14, 15].\\nIn our ongoing research, we have evaluated how age, prevalence of diabetes-related chronic diseases and intercurrent illnesses may be influencing lifestyle. Part of our findings was that the effect of gender and age on total physical activity level is quite significant, but not in the five different domains of physical activity and sedentary time [16]. That is, considering daily activities as a form of exercise that improve health, the interference of ill-health on going to work, social activities, recreation, household and outside chores increases with age, particularly in women. \\nThis can be translated to emphasize a potential significance of sedentary lifestyle change to investigate, but in the context of age and intercurrent illness intervening daily activities. We had reported that while concerted efforts to improve physical activity are required, metabolic syndrome may not be improved by being physically active alone [17]. Hence, we emphasize on how daily activities significantly decreased with increasing age-groups. That is, aging, as a physiological process, intervenes on ability for routine physical activities enroute interference with lifestyle and associated morbidities; while intercurrent illness is equally prevalent across all age-groups and may only constitute confounding interference on lifestyle in older adults. What has yet to be evaluated in our research program is the effectiveness of intensive âlifestyleâ education intervention using peer educators.
