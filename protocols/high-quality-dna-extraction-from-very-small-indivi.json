This approach has a number of advantages: it avoids the risk of accidently pooling together individuals of closely related species, and it enables better resolution of haplotypes by separating non-identical individuals. However, especially in the case of very small invertebrates, recovering sufficient nucleic acid from individual samples can be challenging. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Here we present a method suitable for extraction of DNA from single individual aphids (weighing approximately 0.5mg). We are able to recover 100\u2019s of ng of high-quality DNA suitable for whole-genome sequencing using short-read technologies. DNA extraction using Cetrimonium bromide (CTAB) is a tried and tested method, and the protocol presented here is adapted from that of Marzach\u00ec et al. (1998).
