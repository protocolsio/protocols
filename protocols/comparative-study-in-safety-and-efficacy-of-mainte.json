In most patients, ANCAs against leukocyte proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase (MPO) are detected. Necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affects small vessels, leading to inflammation in various tissues and organs, such as lungs and glomeruli. Timely diagnosis is essential to enable prompt treatment initiation and improve prognosis by limitation of irreversible organ damage. Induction of remission is achieved in the vast majority of patients by high-dose glucocorticoid therapy combined with cyclophosphamide or rituximab, followed by oral glucocorticoid tapering. However, relapses are common, with reported rates ranging from 10 to 60%. Certain factors have been associated with increased risk of relapse, including PR3-ANCA seropositivity, lung or upper respiratory involvement, prior history of relapsing disease, persistence of elevated ANCA titers, particularly PR3-ANCA, and rising ANCA titers. Nonetheless, the optimal immunosuppressant regimen for remission maintenance remains under investigation. The present network meta-analysis is aiming to accumulate current literature knowledge and compare the efficacy and safety of different regimens used for maintenance of remission in patients with ANCA vasculitis.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1194682,"guid":"8C297380CA8511EBA19DA9EB7D863347","previous_id":1194681,"previous_guid":"8C288920CA8511EBA19DA9EB7D863347","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"853F35106A4341B2868E3F5ACDE80170","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"873F0B26609948339C60C15A7D2FC371","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Study design The network meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension Statement for Reporting of Systematic Reviews Incorporating Network Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-NMA) guidelines.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1194683,"guid":"8C2A0FC1CA8511EBA19DA9EB7D863347","previous_id":1194682,"previous_guid":"8C297380CA8511EBA19DA9EB7D863347","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"BC9A2FB2563F4534921BBB2D12D44469","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F9B68AB8EAB7491192A3DF9C8E902F35","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Eligibility criteria Population: Adult patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in complete remission including clinical the phenotypes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and renal-limited disease.
