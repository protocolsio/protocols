The survey questionnaire included three major components—the COVID-19-Related Risk Perception Scale (CRPS), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS-Revision), and Coping Response of COVID-19 Scale (CRCS). Descriptive statistics and a mediated model were used to analyse the collected data.A partial mediation relationship was found between COVID-19-related risk perception and 1) active-response behaviour (β=0.05, 95% Confidence Interval [CI: 0.03, 0.08]), 2) self-protection behaviour through positive emotions (β=0.03, CI [0.01, 0.04]), and 3) risk-taking behaviour through negative emotions (β=-0.04, CI [-0.07, -0.02]). This study’s double-mediation model has been shown to detect the effect coping mechanisms to COVID-19. Furthermore, it implies that public health managers should consider the differences in coping mechanisms and the diverse mediating roles of positive and negative emotions for coping with public health emergencies.
