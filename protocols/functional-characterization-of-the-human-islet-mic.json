Changes in fluorescence intensity were expressed as percentage over baseline (\u0394F\/F). The baseline was defined as the mean of the three first values of the control period of each recording [i.e., in non-stimulatory, basal glucose concentration conditions (3 mM)]. Blood vessels were labeled with DyLight-649 and we could image vessel borders in slices. Quantification of vessel diameter was done as previously described [11]. Briefly, we drew a straight-line transversal to the blood vessel borders (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 3A\u2019 <\/span><span>and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">A\u201d<\/span><span>) and used the \u201creslice\u201d z-function in ImageJ to generate a single image showing the changes in vessel diameter over time (xt scan; temporal projections shown in <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 3C-E<\/span><span>). Noise from reslice images was removed using a median filter (radius = 1 pixel). We drew another line on the xt scan (resliced) image and, using the \u201cplot profile\u201d function, we determined the position of the pixels with the highest fluorescence intensity and considered these the vessel borders. Vessel diameter was calculated by subtracting these 2 position values. To determine the extent of constriction\/dilation, we pooled data on responsive capillaries from different islets from different donors and calculated the relative change in diameter (as fraction of initial vessel diameter). We estimated the proportion of \u201cresponsive capillaries\u201d by dividing the area of the lectin-labeled capillaries that responded to a certain stimulus by the total area of the islet capillary network. <\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1211009,"guid":"972E0730E0E911EB8D6EB7773CFB98E8","previous_id":1211008,"previous_guid":"12A88D50E0E911EB8D6EB7773CFB98E8","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"3D54172C80914AF0BEA973ACF4574F3E","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"9310024A5FB14CA0904FDAC72CEB2B5A","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Immunohistochemistry<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Small pieces of pancreatic tissue were fixed overnight with 4% PFA and then placed in PBS.

Pericytes are complex cells [31]. The unambiguous distinction of pericytes from other perivascular cells requires inspecting their basement membrane at the ultrastructural level [32]. However, pericytes can be identified in tissue sections using antibodies against pericyte surface markers, such as neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRb). Pericytes have a typical bump-on-a-log morphology: a cell body with a prominent nucleus and cytoplasmic processes on the surface of capillaries [31; 33] (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 1H<\/span><span> and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">I<\/span><span>). Following this classification, we have previously reported that mouse and human islet capillaries are covered with pericytes and estimated an average pericyte : endothelial cell ratio of 1:3 \u2013 1:2 for mouse and human islets [11]. Pericytes interact closely with islet endothelial cells and are present on straight parts of islet capillaries as well as at capillary branch points (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 1A<\/span><span>). Interestingly, pericyte density in islets is higher than in the surrounding exocrine tissue (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 1A<\/span><span>; [30]). Pericytes in mouse and human islets also express PDGFRb, although expression of this receptor is not limited to pericytes in human islets [10]. <\/span><\/div><br\/><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dz4a4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div><br\/><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Pericytes in mouse islets have contractile properties [11]. To determine if pericytes in human islets also help regulating islet capillary diameter, we examined in more detail pericytic expression of a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA). aSMA is expressed by cells of smooth muscle cell lineages, allowing us to visualize arterioles that feed into pancreatic islets (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 1B<\/span><span> and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1C<\/span><span>). In most human islets only one feeding arteriole would be seen, in line with previous findings [34]. aSMA positive cells are also present within the human and mouse islet parenchyma (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 1C<\/span><span> and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1D<\/span><span>). The density of aSMA immunostaining inside human islets is higher than what is found in mouse islets (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 1E<\/span><span>), as previously reported [35]. Around 50% of the aSMA positive immunostaining colocalizes with NG2 (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 1C, 1D <\/span><span>and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1F<\/span><span>). This fraction tends to decrease with donor age (data not shown). Importantly, around 60% of the NG2 positive cell population expresses aSMA (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 1C, 1D<\/span><span> and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1G<\/span><span>; [11]). In human islets, a subset of these double positive cells are found tightly wrapping the capillary end of the feeding arteriole (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 1C<\/span><span> and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1H<\/span><span>). These pericytes have a different morphology than those found in the islet parenchyma. Indeed, it is known that pericyte morphology depends on their location in the capillary bed: more circumferential cytoplasmic processes at the arteriole end, more longitudinal processes in the middle, and a stellate morphology towards the venule end of the capillary bed [33]. Given the circumferential morphology of their cytoplasmic processes and the fact that they are associated with an arteriole instead of a capillary (vessel diameter of 8-10 \u00b5m), this type of islet pericytes resembles more a transitional state towards smooth muscle cells. Therefore, in this study, we named them \u201cSMC\u201d pericytes, while pericytes in the human islet parenchyma and covering capillaries are referred to as human islet pericytes (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 1H<\/span><span>). In mouse islets, the morphology of pericytes (and of blood vessels, see <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 2C<\/span><span>) is more homogenous and, thus, we refer to them all as mouse islet pericytes (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 1I<\/span><span>). To summarize, a significant number of mouse and human islet pericytes expresses aSMA, as previously reported for pericytes in the central nervous system [11; 36]. These data indicate that pericytes in human and mouse islets may participate in blood flow regulation but in human islets they are more heterogenous in terms of morphology and contractile protein expression. <\/span><\/div><br\/><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dz364kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div><br\/><br\/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"7BAE71BFEB18442DBCEED06B2E4696ED","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dz4a4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"E3BF8C9D89CD492D8C0CD100E6322FC5","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dz364kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1211093,"guid":"E702FEA0E0F311EB8D6EB7773CFB98E8","previous_id":1211012,"previous_guid":"43961350E0EA11EB8D6EB7773CFB98E8","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"FA3C60DA46E34725A16919BA082C7D63","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Results"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"3AD4E11B4AA347A09AAB6438E21CD2D5","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Vascular trees are preserved in living human and mouse pancreas slices<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Isolated islets are the most common research material used to study the physiology of pancreatic islet cells in humans. However, islets, similarly to other endocrine organs [37], lose a significant amount of their vascular cells during the isolation process and with culture [38]. To overcome this obstacle and be able to study vascular responses in human islets, we adopted the pancreatic slice technique [25; 39]. In pancreas slices the different cellular components of the islet vascular network are preserved [20] and we have used this platform to perform a detailed functional analysis of mouse islet microvascular responses within the native pancreatic environment [11]. Living human pancreas slices produced from fresh tissue samples obtained from the nPOD program have been used by us to compare endocrine cell function in non-diabetics with that of individuals at different stages of type 1 diabetes [26]. In the current study, we have used pancreas slices from six organ donors procured either by nPOD or received locally at the Diabetes Research Institute (<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.frontiersin.org\/articles\/10.3389\/fendo.2020.602519\/full#supplementary-material\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Table S1<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>). Tissue slices were produced within few hours after organ arrival and experiments performed 24h after slicing. In pancreas slices, the morphology of both exocrine and endocrine tissue compartments is preserved and islet endocrine cells can be distinguished from the surrounding tissue due to the strong light scattering properties of mature secretory granules (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 2B<\/span><span>; [40]). The vast majority of cells within pancreas slices is viable and, except for the cutting surface, few dead cells are detected (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 2A<\/span><span>). Previous studies had already shown no signs of increased tissue inflammation or immune cell infiltration in islets from non-diabetic organ donors associated with slicing of living tissue [26; 28].<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Fluorescent lectins (e.g. from <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Lycopersicon esculentum<\/span><span>) that bind to glycoproteins located in the endothelial basement and plasma membranes can be used to visualize blood vessels <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">ex vivo<\/span><span>. While in mice these lectins can be injected intravenously before sacrificing the animals, living human pancreas slices have to be incubated with them after tissue slicing. In any case, lectin labeling allows us to visualize islet vascular trees (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 2C<\/span><span>). Islet feeding arterioles, which are larger blood vessels that branch off into smaller vessels or capillaries, can be seen penetrating the human islet parenchyma or at the border in mouse islets (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 2C<\/span><span>). Notably, mouse and human islet capillaries do not collapse during slicing and a lumen is still present in many of them, allowing us to monitor changes in islet vessel diameter by confocal microscopy. Unlike mouse slices, which can be produced from transgenic animals that express genetically encoded fluorescent indicators in specific cell types (e.g. from transgenic mice that express GCaMP3 in pericytes; see <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 5<\/span><span> and [11]), human slices have to be incubated with indicators that report on cellular activity.

These include signals from neighboring endothelial cells or metabolically active endocrine cells and extrinsic signals, for instance, from the nervous system [16]. We have previously observed that mouse islet capillaries are responsive to these islet intrinsic or extrinsic inputs [11]. Using living human pancreas slices, we investigated whether these different signals triggered vasomotion in the human islet. Of note, only a subset of islet capillaries (15-20%) exhibited vasomotion in mouse and human islets and was responsive to applied stimuli <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">ex vivo<\/span><span> (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 3B<\/span><span>). Norepinephrine is endogenously released by sympathetic nerves that innervate blood vessels in the human islet [35]. Exogenous norepinephrine (NE, 20 \u00b5M) administration significantly constricted the feeding arteriole in human islets (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 3C, 3F<\/span><span> and <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3G<\/span><span>; average reduction of arteriole diameter ~12%) and a subset of human and mouse islet capillaries (5% reduction in human islet capillary diameter; <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 3D-G<\/span><span>). Endothelins are vasoconstrictor peptides endogenously produced by endothelial cells [43]. Exogenous administration of endothelin 1 (ET-1, 10 nM) led to powerful constriction of human islet feeding arterioles, as well as of human and mouse islet capillaries (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figures 3C-E<\/span><span> and<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> 3G<\/span><span>).

Adenosine is an important mediator of the metabolic blood flow regulation in many tissues. We had previously published that adenosine, endogenously produced from ATP co-released with insulin, mediates the increase in islet capillary diameter and blood flow upon stimulation of mouse islet beta cells with high glucose [11]. Regarding human islets, exogenous adenosine administration (ADO, 50 \u00b5M) dilated human islet arterioles by 10% and had no significant effect on human islet capillary diameter (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 3G<\/span><span>).<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"B33D934611334FF2A3FD5A8AD2BB52F3","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dz4e4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"00710AE5F4C648C0807C5A74E86AF9E9","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dz4i4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1211956,"guid":"09D888E0E31B11EBAF85EF68B5A69CF0","previous_id":1211955,"previous_guid":"DAC8F530E31A11EBAF85EF68B5A69CF0","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"10EB336F25BD4AB5A8F4A17DCD2CFBC2","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Results"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"A01B768D7A0E438F8FBE15863D197255","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Vasoactive substances change [Ca<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;vertical-align:super;\">2+<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;vertical-align:super;vertical-align:sub;\">]<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;vertical-align:sub;\">i<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> levels in human and mouse islet mural cells<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Our next goal was to better characterize the mechanisms that induce vasomotion in human islets, similarly to what we had done in the mouse.

Briefly, initiation of a vasoconstrictor myogenic response, for instance, involves an increase in intracellular free calcium levels in mural cells and calmodulin-dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase. This kinase, in turn, phosphorylates myosin light chain and stimulates the formation of cross bridges between myosin and actin filaments, leading to vasoconstriction [45].

In human islets, a subset of islet pericytes and smooth muscle cell-like (\u201cSMC\u201d) pericytes express the contractile protein aSMA. We measured vasomotion in different types of islet blood vessels in response to exogenous administration of norepinephrine, endothelin-1 and adenosine. We found that islet feeding arterioles and a small subset of capillaries constrict upon norepinephrine and endothelin-1, but only arterioles dilate upon adenosine. We further determined that changes in blood vessel diameter are coupled to changes in cytosolic calcium levels in adjacent pericytes or \u201cSMC\u201d pericytes. Our study points to pericytes as targets of several regulatory mechanisms of islet blood perfusion, similarly to their role in mouse islets.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Our data support that blood flow in the human islet can be regulated locally at the level of the feeding arteriole and of a subset (~15-20%) of islet capillaries, similar to what has been described in rodents [11; 48; 49; 50]. Here we show that changes in the activity of islet pericytes and \u201cSMC\u201d pericytes mediate vasomotion in human islets and propose that these cells function as local gates. Given recent functional evidence in mice that the islet microcirculation is open and not isolated from that of the surrounding exocrine tissue [51], and the fact that in humans an islet-portal circulatory system is also well developed [41], the existence of such a gating system would allow islet blood flow to be regulated independently of the exocrine tissue under certain conditions, as previously suggested [52]. <\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">In this study we perform a functional and anatomical cross comparison of the islet microvasculature between mice and humans. Previous studies had already shown that the architecture and density of islet vascular trees differed significantly between these two species [13; 20]. Our analysis has revealed that also the morphology of islet pericytes and blood vessels is more heterogenous in human islets than in mouse islets. Human islets contain a subset of pericytes whose circular cytoplasmic processes give them a smooth muscle cell-like morphology and, therefore, we named them \u201cSMC\u201d pericytes. These type of pericytes localize on the surface of islet feeding arterioles (larger blood vessels that enter the islet parenchyma). Given their location and calcium response profile, \u201cSMC\u201d pericytes resemble precapillary sphincters. The existence of a sphincter-like mechanism had already been reported in monkey islets transplanted into the anterior chamber of the monkey eye [53]. Here we show that exogenous norepinephrine induces a stronger activation of islet \u201cSMC\u201d pericytes than of mouse and human islet pericytes and a concomitant and powerful constriction of human islet feeding arterioles. Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter released at sympathetic nerve terminals. While in mouse islets sympathetic axons equally innervate islet blood vessels and endocrine cells at the periphery, in human islets sympathetic nerves preferentially contact contractile elements around islet blood vessels [35]. Thus, sympathetic modulation of islet hormone secretion in humans may occur in part by affecting islet blood flow [54]. Disruption of this mechanism may contribute, for instance, to the impaired glucagon secretion characteristic of type 1 diabetics [55], as loss of islet sympathetic nerves has been seen in mouse models of type 1 diabetes [56] and in type 1 diabetic patients [57].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>We further show that mouse and human islet blood vessels and their mural cells are very responsive to the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1.

While a lot is known about rodent islet blood vessels, the structure and function of the human islet microvasculature has been less investigated. In this study, we used living pancreas slices from non-diabetic human donors to examine the function of human islet blood vessels. Living human pancreas slices were incubated with a membrane permeant calcium indicator and pericytes\/smooth muscle cells were visualized with a fluorescent antibody against the mural cell marker NG2 proteoglycan. By confocal microscopy, we simultaneously recorded changes in the diameter of lectin-labeled blood vessels and cytosolic calcium levels in mural cells in islets. We tested several stimuli with vasoactive properties, such as norepinephrine, endothelin-1 and adenosine and compared human vascular responses with those previously published for mouse islet blood vessels. Norepinephrine and endothelin-1 significantly constricted human islet feeding arterioles, while adenosine dilated them. Islet capillaries were less responsive and only 15-20% of the mouse and human islet capillary network showed vasomotion. Nevertheless, in these responsive regions, norepinephrine and endothelin-1 decreased both mouse and human islet capillary diameter. Changes in islet blood vessel diameter were coupled to changes in cytosolic calcium levels in adjacent mouse and human islet mural cells. Our study shows that mural cells in islets are the targets of different regulatory mechanisms of islet blood perfusion. Several alterations of the human islet microvasculature occur during diabetes progression. Elucidating their functional consequences in future studies will be critical for our understanding of disease pathogenesis.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1626712473}
