As with all animal models, husbandry conditions, including environmental parameters, nutrition, and exposure to pathogens can affect research results. Additionly, zebrafish are tolerant of a wide range of environmental parameters, which has led to wide variation in husbandry practices across facilities around the world. The lack of standard conditions across zebrafish laboratories may play a role in irreproducible experiments. Therefore, a summary of these conditions for the year 2018 have been compiled for a project requiring separate space from the Zebrafish Aquaculture Core (ZAC) facility at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Chapel Hill. For this project a new flow-through rack was installed in the Berryhill building.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Since the project aimes to investigate differences in health status among the fish, all health data has been omitted from this summary.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1570638127}
