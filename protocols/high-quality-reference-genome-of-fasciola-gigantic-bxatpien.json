In the present study, we used various sequencing and assembly technologies to generate a new high-quality Fasciola gigantica reference genome. We improved the integration of gene structure prediction, and identified two independent transposable element expansion events contributing to (1) the speciation between Fasciola and Fasciolopsis during the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary mass extinction, and (2) the habitat switch to the liver during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, accompanied by gene length increment. Long interspersed element (LINE) duplication contributed to the second transposon-mediated alteration, showing an obvious trend of insertion into gene regions, regardless of strong purifying effect. Gene ontology analysis of genes with long LINE insertions identified membrane-associated and vesicle secretion process proteins, further implicating the functional alteration of the gene network. We identified 852 predicted excretory/secretory proteins and 3300 protein-protein interactions between Fasciola gigantica and its host. Among them, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase genes, with specific gene copy number variations, might play a central role in the phase I detoxification process. Analysis of 559 single-copy orthologs suggested that Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica diverged at 11.8 Ma near the Middle and Late Miocene Epoch boundary. We identified 98 rapidly evolving gene families, including actin and aquaporin, which might explain the large body size and the parasitic adaptive character resulting in these liver flukes becoming epidemic in tropical and subtropical regions.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":18},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":23,\"length\":17},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":68,\"length\":12},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":356,\"length\":18},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":694,\"length\":36},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":1268,\"length\":18},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":1514,\"length\":18},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":1537,\"length\":17}],\"entityRanges\":[{\"key\":0,\"offset\":544,\"length\":44},{\"key\":1,\"offset\":872,\"length\":56},{\"key\":2,\"offset\":969,\"length\":58},{\"key\":3,\"offset\":1027,\"length\":136},{\"key\":4,\"offset\":1226,\"length\":73}],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{\"0\":{\"type\":\"link\",\"mutability\":\"\",\"data\":{\"guid\":\"277DF06CFA4A11EB878B0A58A9FEAC02\",\"url\":null}},\"1\":{\"type\":\"link\",\"mutability\":\"\",\"data\":{\"guid\":\"277DF0B3FA4A11EB878B0A58A9FEAC02\",\"url\":null}},\"2\":{\"type\":\"link\",\"mutability\":\"\",\"data\":{\"guid\":\"277DF151FA4A11EB878B0A58A9FEAC02\",\"url\":null}},\"3\":{\"type\":\"link\",\"mutability\":\"\",\"data\":{\"guid\":\"277DF0D3FA4A11EB878B0A58A9FEAC02\",\"url\":null}},\"4\":{\"type\":\"link\",\"mutability\":\"\",\"data\":{\"guid\":\"277DF0F2FA4A11EB878B0A58A9FEAC02\",\"url\":null}}}}","disclaimer":"","document":"","documents":[{"id":0,"type_id":0,"filename":"","key":"","color":"","height":0,"width":0,"is_document":null,"original_file_id":null,"thumb_url":"https://www.protocols.io/img/extensions/doc.png","size":null,"is_private":0,"is_new":0,"ofn":"Manuscript for Fasiola gigantica.doc","url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/protocols-files/files/d6wdbmspp.doc","bucket_name":null,"s3_webp_url":"","file_id":127619}],"doi":"dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bxatpien","doi_status":2,"fork_id":null,"fork_info":null,"forks":[],"funders":[],"groups":[],"guid":"9A03A9A0FA4911EB98F26DADDB82F095","guidelines":"","has_references":false,"has_versions":false,"id":52275,"image":{"source":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_source":null,"placeholder":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_placeholder":null},"image_attribution":"","in_trash":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_contact_suspended":false,"is_content_confidential":false,"is_content_warning":false,"is_in_transfer":false,"is_owner":true,"is_retracted":false,"is_shared_directly":false,"is_subprotocol":null,"is_unlisted":false,"item_id":819271,"journal":null,"journals":[{"journal_id":"10.1371/journal.pntd.0009750","name":"PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases","group_id":2,"link":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009750","citation":"Luo X,  Cui K,  Wang Z,  Li Z,  Wu Z,  Huang W,  Zhu X,  Ruan J,  Zhang W,  Liu Q (2021) High-quality reference genome of \u003ci\u003eFasciola gigantica\u003c/i\u003e: Insights into the genomic signatures of transposon-mediated evolution and specific parasitic adaption in tropical regions.

Among the eight species, 559 single-copy orthologs were aligned using MUSCLE (v3.8.1551) (90), and we eliminated poorly aligned positions and divergent regions of the alignment using Gblock 0.91b (91). RAxML (v8.2.12) was then used with the PROTGAMMALGF model to estimate a maximum likelihood tree. Divergence times were estimated using PAML MCMCTREE (92). A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process was run for 2,000,000 iterations, with a sample frequency of 100 after a burn-in of 1,000 iterations under an independent rates model. Two independent runs were performed to check the convergence. The fossil‑calibrated eukaryote phylogeny was used to set the root height for the species tree, taken from the age of Animals (602–661 Ma) estimated in a previous fossil‑calibrated eukaryotic phylogeny (93) and the divergence time between the euarchontoglires and laurasiatheria: (95.3–113 Ma) (94).\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":294,\"length\":12},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":323,\"length\":11},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":360,\"length\":18},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":404,\"length\":19},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":449,\"length\":19},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":494,\"length\":16}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":52275,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"6","cases":[],"critical":null}],"template_id":4,"title":"High-quality
