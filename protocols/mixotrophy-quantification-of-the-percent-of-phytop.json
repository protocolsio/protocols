The percent of cells with beads was determined in samples fixed with Lugol's iodine solution (protocol explained in detail here) and enumerated with a flow cytometer (Guava easyCyte, Luminex Corporation, USA) where cells that contained chlorophyll as well as green fluorescence (same signal as the prey added, YG-beads or FLBs) were considered to be cells containing prey (quantification protocol explain in detail here). To determine the uptake of prey over time the percent of cells with preys was quantified in each experimental flask by first adding preys and then sub-sampling and fixing after an incubation of 0 (T0), 20 (T20) and 40 (T40) minutes. The T0 sample accounts for the physical attachment of preys to the cell and therefore the percent of cells ingesting prey corresponds to the percent of cells with prey at T20 or T40, minus the percent of cells with prey at T0.  <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">References<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sherr, EB. & Sherr, BF.
