The authors have conceptualised a framework specific to TS/S, called the ‘Strategic Healthcare Implementation Framework for Task Shifting, Sharing and Resource Enhancement’ (SHIFT-SHARE). Its building blocks are based on popular change management theories, implementation models and program assessment tools. SHIFT-SHARE has six stages laid down in a cycle, each offering stepwise direction on how to operationalise TS/S. The following protocol will now be used to evaluate real-world validity, applicability and utility of SHIFT-SHARE. The protocol can be adopted and used by researchers attempting to evaluate similar aspects of other implementation frameworks or service delivery models. \",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":10}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"84gp1\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ba20j\",\"text\":\"Objectives: The current protocol describes how data on stakeholder experiences with TS/S in context of health services in India will be collected and how their viewpoints on SHIFT-SHARE will be analysed, to further incorporate their recommendations and fine-tune SHIFT-SHARE. Primary objectives of this planned study are (1) to examine whether services adhere to the overarching philosophy of SHIFT-SHARE and (2) to study how organisations incorporate each component of SHIFT-SHARE into implementation processes and assess quality markers at each stage. Secondary objectives are (1) to appraise enablers and barriers to TS/S in context of SHIFT-SHARE, with a focus on power dynamics, sociocultural norms and regulatory policies, (2) to understand whether front-line healthcare providers get opportunities to contribute to or provide feedback at different stages of TS/S and review these in context of SHIFT-SHARE, (3) to appreciate provider and recipient experiences with TS/S and place these in context of SHIFT-SHARE and (4) to investigate whether TS/S has been reversed after being implemented and learn why. \",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":10}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"2c3rt\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ecitk\",\"text\":\"Methodology: The study will be qualitative and mixed-methods.
