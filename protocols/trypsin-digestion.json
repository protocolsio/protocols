Briefly, 15 \u00b5L of Digestion Buffer (50 mM Ammonium bicarbonate) and 1.5\u00b5L of Reducing Buffer (100mM Dithiothreitol) were added to 10uL of the protein solution to the micro-centrifuge tube and the final volume was adjusted to 27 \u00b5L with ultrapure water. The samples were incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 45 minutes and allowed to cool at room temperature. 3 \u00b5L of freshly prepared alkylation buffer (100mM Iodoacetamide) was then added to the tube and kept for incubation in the dark at room temperature for 20 minutes. Finally, 10 \u00b5L of Trypsin (20\u00b5g\/ml) solution was added in the tube and kept for incubation at 37\u00b0C for 15 hours (overnight)(25).<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1596655224}
