MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. Individual randomized-controlled trials for adult patients undergoing cardiac catheterization will be included. The primary outcomes will be the successful cannulation rate and the incidence of radial artery spasm (RAS) and radial artery occlusion (RAO). Study selection, data abstraction and quality assessment will be independently performed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1610263729}
