The method is an inexpensive, fast, and easy-to-use protocol for measuring pain-like responses in adult zebrafish. The protocol involves five steps: analyses of baseline behavior, drug injection, post-injection recordings of behavior, euthanasia, and data analyses\/interpretation. Intraperitoneal injection of 2.5\u20135.0% acetic acid elicits a robust pain-like behavior by changing zebrafish body curvature, which can be easily quantified using freely available imaging software. This response is sensitive to pharmacological manipulations, as morphine prevents altered body curvature, while naloxone blocks these effects. Pretreatment with diclofenac sodium (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly used as an analgesic) also prevents writhing-like behavior. Demonstrating high predictive and face validity, this unbiased protocol can be performed over the course of ~2 days, enabling a reliable assessment of acute pain-like responses in zebrafish, thus fostering in-depth analyses of complex pain-related mechanisms and anti-pain drug discovery.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1626463192}
