The grid can either hide a unicorn beneath one of the tiles or else it can be absent from the grid. Either event can occur with equal probability. At the beginning of each round, the computer chooses whether or not there is a unicorn, and if there is one, it randomly chooses a tile---each one having an equal probability of being chosen---and places the unicorn beneath it. Then, players have to guess whether there is a unicorn or if it is absent from the grid by uncovering tiles one at a time, with both players uncovering tiles simultaneously, in order to see what lies beneath them. What tiles have been uncovered and whether there is or not a unicorn is only known to the player that uncovers these tiles. However, in the event that both players uncover the same tile, it changes its color and both players can immediately see this. At any time during the round, each player can make a guess as to whether the unicorn is present or absent from the grid. The other player will know this information and they can use it to inform their own guess. The round ends when both players announce that their guess is a final decision, and then they are shown their individual scores from the round. The score depends on whether the player's guess is correct (32 points) or incorrect (-64 points), subtracting the number of tiles that were uncovered by both players. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1617277229}
