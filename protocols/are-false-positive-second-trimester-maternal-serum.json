Medline will be used additionally due to its ability for adjacency searching. Web of Science, CINAHL and Scopus will be used to insure that smaller studies were located. Hand-searches of available abstracts from major conference proceedings will also be screened for eligibility including the Fetal Medicine Foundation (UK), the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (USA), and the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis. Grey literature will be identified using Google Scholar and Proquest Dissertations. Studies published from inception until latest available year are eligible for inclusion. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Search strategies <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The search strategy will comprise of three general concepts: i) \u201cmaternal serum screening\u201d; 2) \u201cfalse-positive results\u201d; and 3) \u201cadverse pregnancy outcomes\u201d. Medical subject headings (or equivalent) and text word terms were used for all search concepts along with their related words and synonyms, and search strategies will then be individualized to the specific databases mentioned previously.

The author of this manuscript will perform the selection of studies independently. First, all titles will be reviewed for possible relevance. Abstracts of relevant citations will then be screened for inclusion criteria. Based on this review of abstracts, all potential studies will be classified as: include, exclude, unclear or duplicate. The full text of all reports classified as either \u2018include\u2019 or \u2018unclear\u2019 will then be retrieved and reviewed for possible inclusion in this manuscript. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Data abstraction and management <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Once the final roster of \u2018included\u2019 papers is assembled, the authors will independently assess the full text of all these remaining studies using a standardized form (Appendix F). Data will be entered into a Microsoft Excel database (Excel v.14, Microscoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA).

If one or more areas is adjudicated as having a high risk of bias, the study will be classified as being a high risk of bias and excluded from the meta-analysis. If all components of a trial were classified as having a low risk of bias, the trial was included in the meta-analysis. In cases of mixed assessments of low and\/or unclear risk of bias, overall classification will be of moderate or unclear bias. In cases where missing background information about the study design\/methodology was responsible for the \u2018unclear\u2019 adjudication, attempt will be made to contact the primary authors via email on two separate occasions for additional clarification.

The CMA software was chosen instead of other potential statistical software platforms given its ability to allow for input of multiple different data types. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>    Given the dichotomous nature of the outcomes of interest, a decision has been made a priori to present pooled odds ratios as the measure of effect. Pooled odds ratios will be calculated for each outcome by subgroup of MSS testing (ie: double-marker or triple-marker) and as a pooled combined estimate overall. A random-effects model has been chosen to calculate the pooled odds ratios given that the background literature suggested there could be variability of the effect size amongst studies.<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">27<\/span><span> Whenever outcomes were reported by individual studies as number of events per group or as proportions, those values will be transformed into odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals using the CMA statistical software when appropriate.

While combinations of these markers are used to predict the risk of Down syndrome there is some literature to suggest that individual markers may also predict an increased risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between false-positive, second-trimester MSS tests and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes amongst singleton pregnancies globally.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of Pubmed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, as well as hand-searches of scientific meeting abstracts (Fetal Medicine Foundation, Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine, and the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis) andother grey literature sources (ProQuest Dissertations and Google Scholar) to latest available date (estimated Dec 2018).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">STUDY SELECTION: Observational studies comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes amongst singleton pregnancies with false-positive second-trimester maternal serum screening tests to those of screen-negative singleton controls. Outcomes of interest include preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and stillbirth.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">DATA EXTRACTION (& Methods): Using a standardized data extraction form, the author will independently screen studies, extract data, and assess quality of eligible studies. Following a qualitative synthesis of relevant studies, a meta-analysis will be performed. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be pooled by individual outcome and type of maternal serum screen test type to generate summary effect estimates for the outcomes of interest. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">CONCLUSIONS: There is conflicting evidence in the literature about the relationship, if any, between false-positive, second-trimester maternal serum screens and risk of placentally-mediated complications of pregnancy. Given that this research question can only be explored using observational studies, it lends itself ideally to pursuit of a systematic review and synthesis of results using meta-analysis.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1611116179}
