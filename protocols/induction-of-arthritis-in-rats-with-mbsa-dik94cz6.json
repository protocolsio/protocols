The stereological point counting method (GUNDERSEN et al., 1988) was used to quantify the immunostained cells and cytokines; a reticular grid with 100 points distributed orthogonally on the acquired image was used. Ten fields of synovial tissue were evaluated at a magnification of 1000×, and cell expression was determined according to the number of positive cells coinciding with the crosshair grid in each field and is expressed as the percentage of positive cells relative to the total number of cells. To quantify the area of synovial tissue occupied by collagen fibers, images were acquired at a magnification of 400×, and 10 fields of view were evaluated. The collagen fibers were evaluated by selecting the fluorescent green hue corresponding to each type of collagen stained. The immunostained area was divided by the total area of the analyzed tissue, and the result was expressed as a percentage.\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":104833,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"7","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":2172483,"guid":"FD862F80B7934E169A6B5ED6B876AA02","previous_id":2172482,"previous_guid":"098F61DB66A040228D22070CD36B122E","section":"\u003cp\u003eMaterials and Methods\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"9a93e\",\"text\":\"Cell culture and IL-10 production analysis\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":42}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"5q7ka\",\"text\":\"The spleens of the IA and IA-Col V groups were collected aseptically and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin for maceration through a metal mesh for cell separation.
