Research in these areas are usually carried out using deep learning to detect complex nonlinear patterns in students' learning sequences. However, the volatility and sparsity of data always weaken the performance of deep neural networks. Prevailing approaches always required an additional data smoothing or interpolation step independent of the prediction model, which may lose valuable information or introduce inauthentic data. Besides, when modeling the SDP problem as a binary classification task, previous works often required to specify an observation window, which may lead to inconsistent prediction results with different settings. To address these issues in an end-to-end learning framework, we propose a Survival Analysis based Volatility and Sparsity Modeling Network (SAVSNet). Particularly, SAVSNet smooths the volatile time series by convolution network while preserving the original data information using Long-Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). Furthermore, we propose a Time-Missing-Aware LSTM unit to mitigate the impact of data sparsity by integrating informative missingness patterns into the model. To achieve consistent predictions along time, a survival analysis loss fuction is adopted for parameter estimation and the model outputs monotonically decreasing survival probabilities. In the experiments, we compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods in two real-world MOOC datasets and the experiment results show the effectiveness of our proposed model.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"","document":"","documents":[],"doi":"dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.b4duqs6w","doi_status":2,"fork_id":null,"fork_info":null,"forks":[],"funders":[],"groups":[],"guid":"8017BC507F1611EC8B451B47E72E74A6","guidelines":"","has_references":false,"has_versions":false,"id":57492,"image":{"source":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_source":null,"placeholder":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_placeholder":null},"image_attribution":"","in_trash":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_contact_suspended":false,"is_content_confidential":false,"is_content_warning":false,"is_in_transfer":false,"is_owner":true,"is_retracted":false,"is_shared_directly":false,"is_subprotocol":null,"is_unlisted":false,"item_id":868966,"journal":null,"journals":[{"journal_id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0267138","name":"PLOS One","group_id":2,"link":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267138","citation":"Pan F,  Huang B,  Zhang C,  Zhu X,  Wu Z,  Zhang M,  Ji Y,  Ma Z,  Li Z (2022) A survival analysis based volatility and sparsity modeling network for student dropout prediction.

(1) In the volatility modeling network, we leverage a dual-branch structure, which is consisted of an 1D convolutaional network to capture the spatial dependencies of multivariate time series and an LSTM network to learn the temporal dependency, respectively. Then we ultilize an update gate to adaptively fuse the two hidden representations. (2) In the sparsity modeling network, we use a customized Time-Missing-Aware LSTM (TM-LSTM) unit to take the elapsed time and missing indicator between the consecutive timestamps of a sequence into consideration to adjust the long-term and short-term memory content of the LSTM unit. (3) In the survival analysis network, we apply a softplus function to transform the output of TM-LSTM into hazard rate that represents the instantaneous hazard of the student given no dropout event occurred before. Then we employ a survival analysis loss function to estimate the hazard rates. Accordingly, the survival probability at each time step is obtained by the formula ${S_t} = {e^{ - \\\\sum\\\\nolimits_{k = 1}^t {{\\\\lambda _k}} }}$. By comparing the survival probability at the last timestamp with a threshold $\\\\tau$, we can predict whether a user would dropout of the course.We use the Tensorflow1.x platform to build this model and the source code will be published at: https://github.com/leondepf/SAVSNet.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"key\":0,\"offset\":1477,\"length\":35}],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{\"0\":{\"type\":\"link\",\"mutability\":\"\",\"data\":{\"guid\":\"103F290E80E511ECB8EC0A58A9FEAC02\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/cns-iu/edx-learnertrajectorynetpipeline/tree/master/data\"}}}}","data":null,"protocol_id":57492,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"3","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":1333759,"guid":"52CEB1B080E011EC9EF74FEF675C1DFA","previous_id":1333758,"previous_guid":"4891630080E011EC9EF74FEF675C1DFA","section":"","section_color":"","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"df61j\",\"text\":\"Model training and testing:\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"bvtf2\",\"text\":\"The data is trained in the built model, and this process is carried out on the GPU.
