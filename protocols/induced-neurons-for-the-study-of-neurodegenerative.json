Overexpression of certain neurogenic transcription factors (TFs) in iPSCs can induce efficient differentiation into homogeneous populations of the disease-relevant neuronal cell types. Here we provide protocols for genomic manipulations of iPSCs by CRISPR\/Cas9. We also introduce two methods, based on lentiviral delivery and the piggyBac transposon system, to stably integrate neurogenic TFs into human iPSCs. Furthermore, we describe the TF-mediated neuronal differentiation and maturation in combination with astrocyte cocultures.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617671}
