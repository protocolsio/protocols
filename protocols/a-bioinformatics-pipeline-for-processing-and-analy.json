class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Recent advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have paved the way for augmented genomic research. From the conventional microarray analysis to the current NGS-based whole transcriptome pipelines, there have been significant advances on how differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified. With several bioinformatics pipelines in use, inferring the candidate DEGs prove to be a cumbersome approach as one may have to reach consensus in analysing the results from various pipelines. To ensure this, we have benchmarked the well-known Cufflinks-Cuffdiff pipeline on a set of datasets and present it in the form of a protocol for the research community interested in performing downstream analysis of whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Keywords: <\/span><span>RNA-Seq, Transcriptome analysis, bioinformatics pipeline, differentially expressed genes  <\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1624946987}
