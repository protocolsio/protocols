Our assay relies on malachite green, an inexpensive basic dye, that in the presence of molybdate forms a green complex with orthophosphate hydrolysed from the phospho-substrate during the PPM1H phosphatase reaction. This green malachite orthophosphate complex can be conveniently measured on a spectrophotometer (620 nm). The assay is straightforward and rapid. It involves a single addition step for initiating and terminating the reaction. The assays can be conveniently performed in 96 well plate format and can be adapted to compare the intrinsic activity of different protein phosphatases as well as impact of mutations.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1623914761}
