The immobilization strategy determines how the target protein is presented to the binders and thereby directly affects the experimental outcome. This poses specific challenges for membrane proteins due to their inherent lack of stability and limited exposed hydrophilic surfaces. Here we detail methodologies for the selective immobilization of membrane proteins based on the strong biotin-avidin interaction and with a specific focus on its application for the selection of nanobodies and sybodies. We discuss the challenges in generating and benefits of obtaining an equimolar biotin to target-protein ratio.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617654}
