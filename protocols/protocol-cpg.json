Economic assessments help determine the efficiency of health interventions and services, making it easier for both managers and healthcare professionals to make decisions under real clinical practice conditions [2]. To do this, it is necessary that, in addition to driving the studies according to the best methodological quality standards, both the data and methodological used and the results obtained are accessible to the scientific community, that is, communicated in the publications in a transparent and truthful way [3]. It has been observed that the quality with which this information is communicated on economic health studies in Spain is insufficient [4]. These authors consider that without the submission of comprehensive and transparent reports describing how these studies were designed and conducted, it is difficult to assess the validity of their results and conclusions. Recently, this same group has published a protocol for developing a study evaluating the degree of reproducibility and transparency of a representative sample of such economic assessments [5]. Finally, it is considered that the incorporation of economic studies in the development of clinical practice guidelines should contribute to reducing the variation in care practice, the amount of ineffective care and wasted on research and resources [6], thus improving health outcomes by encouraging the use of the most cost-efficient therapies [7]. However, such guidelines would not be appropriate, even if they followed the best standards for their development, if we could not externally validate such studies, which would increase uncertainty about their results.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">[1] Ioannidis JP, Greenland S, Hlatky MA, Khoury MJ, Macleod MR, Moher D, et al.
