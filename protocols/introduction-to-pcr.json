The primary reagents involved in a PCR lab are oligonucleotides called primers and DNA polymerase. The first thing that happens is that the DNA duplex is denatured, and the two strands are unannealed from each other. The primers are then added so that when the temperature is lowered they can ligate onto their complementary regions. Now, these new primers will serve as templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically begin adding nucleotides to it and begin the process of creating a new strand of DNA. As each nucleotide is added, it serves as a template for the next nucleotide, creating a chain reaction where the original DNA sequence is amplified exponentially. <\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">Key Components<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">DNA Template: <\/span><span>Target DNA region one intends to amplify<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">DNA Polymerase: <\/span><span>Enzyme that polymerizes more DNA strands<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">DNA Primers: <\/span><span>Two DNA primers that are complementary to the 3\u2019 end of both strands of DNA; what serves as the template for DNA polymerase to bind and elongate the strand<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">dNTPs: <\/span><span>The building blocks of what DNA polymerase makes the new strand of DNA from<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">PCR can be broken down into three stages.

Electrophoresis involves running an electrical current through a gel containing the molecules of interest. The gel is composed of many pores. The pores allow the molecules to move through them. Based on their size and charge, the molecules will travel through the gel in different directions or at different speeds, allowing them to be separated from one another. All DNA molecules have the same amount of charge per mass. Because of this, gel electrophoresis of DNA fragments separates them based on size only. The smaller the molecule the faster and further it travels, while the bigger the molecule the slower and closer it travels. Using electrophoresis, we can see how many different DNA fragments are present in a sample and how large they are relative to one another.

The current is produced by 2 electrodes placed at different ends of the box containing the gel electrophoresis. DNA has an overall negative charge, so the DNA will move from the negative electrode in the direction of the positive electrode. In the gel, we produce multiple wells. Each well holds one sample of DNA and one well of DNA must always hold a DNA ladder. A DNA ladder is a reference for DNA samples, it displays multiple bands of DNA where the size is already known. This creates a reference for the DNA samples.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Resources<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bento.bio\/protocol\/biotechnology-101\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">Bento lab Resources page<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/science\/biology\/biotech-dna-technology\/dna-sequencing-pcr-electrophoresis\/a\/gel-electrophoresis\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">Gel electrophoresis (Khan; article)<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/gubLAtn2o4s\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/_EYsykjsfiY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ZDZUAleWX78\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Disclaimer:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">The information provided on this document is intended for the educational purposes of the BME 22L laboratory course.
