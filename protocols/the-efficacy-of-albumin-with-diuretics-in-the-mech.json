Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the effect of albumin was limited only to transient improvements of urine volume[10]. However, this analysis did not investigate the mechanically ventilated critically ill patients. Although a systematic review in 2014 was conducted to investigate that colloids could improve diuresis in patients mechanically ventilated, this review did not include recent RCTs[11]. Thus, we still don't have a clear answer for the improvement of the haemodynamic stability, mortality or ventilator free days.\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Our aim is to clarify the benefit of albumin administration for the mechanically ventilated patients in combination with the diuresis in this systematic review and meta-analysis.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1605325330}
