One of the characteristic features of yawning is its timing, consisting in a progressive acceleration, followed by an abrupt deceleration in the intensity of the facial muscle Action Units (AUs) involved, designated by numeric codes and verbal labels. Yawning usually emerges from a relaxed face, initially involving mouth opening (AUs 25, 26, 27) and eyes closing (AU 43E), followed by upper eyelid drooping (AU 43A-D), flattened tongue on the bottom of the mouth (AU 75) and usually swallowing (AU 80).
