However, current strategies mainly rely on genome\u2010integrating viruses. Here, we used synthetic mRNAs coding two proneural TFs (Atoh1 and Ngn2) to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. mRNAs coding Atoh1 and Ngn2 with defined phosphosite modifications led to higher and more stable protein expression, and induced more efficient neuron conversion, as compared to mRNAs coding wild\u2010type proteins. Using these two modified mRNAs with morphogens, we established a 5\u2010day protocol that can rapidly generate mDA neurons with >90% purity from normal and Parkinson's disease iPSCs. After in vitro maturation, these mRNA\u2010induced mDA (miDA) neurons recapitulate key biochemical and electrophysiological features of primary mDA neurons and can provide high\u2010content neuron cultures for drug discovery. Proteomic analysis of Atoh1\u2010binding proteins identified the nonmuscle myosin II (NM\u2010II) complex as a new binding partner of nuclear Atoh1. The NM\u2010II complex, commonly known as an ATP\u2010dependent molecular motor, binds more strongly to phosphosite\u2010modified Atoh1 than the wild type. Blebbistatin, an NM\u2010II complex antagonist, and bradykinin, an NM\u2010II complex agonist, inhibited and promoted, respectively, the transcriptional activity of Atoh1 and the efficiency of miDA neuron generation. These findings established the first mRNA\u2010driven strategy for efficient iPSC differentiation to mDA neurons. We further identified the NM\u2010II complex as a positive modulator of Atoh1\u2010driven neuron differentiation. The methodology described here will facilitate the development of mRNA\u2010driven differentiation strategies for generating iPSC\u2010derived progenies widely applicable to disease modeling and cell replacement therapy.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1600288164}
