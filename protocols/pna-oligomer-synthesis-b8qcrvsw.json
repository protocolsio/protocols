Nielsen et al in Rose Laboratory of the University of Copenhagen used a simple computer DNA model to successfully design and synthesize PNA and PNA in 1991. The synthesis of PNA is first to synthesize the monomers, and then oligomerize the PNA monomers according to the standard peptide synthesis method. The structural unit of PNA is modified amino acid, so it can be prepared in large quantities by peptide synthesis, and it can also be prepared by chemical synthesis by attaching functional groups to the N-terminus or C-terminus. PNA oligomers are prepared from protected PNA monomers by solid-phase synthesis, and their protection strategies, condensation conditions, deprotection methods and purification methods are similar to those of peptide synthesis.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"key\":0,\"offset\":357,\"length\":12}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"f3ck4\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"4rft2\",\"text\":\"Creative Peptidesteam has accumulated rich experience in PNA chemistry, we can provide two chemical synthesis methods to synthesize PNA oligomers, including Boc chemistry and Fmoc chemistry.
