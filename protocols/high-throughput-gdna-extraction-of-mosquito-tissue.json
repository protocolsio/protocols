Many studies operate at the population level of those diseases and as such, it is of immense value to have a high-throughput method of gDNA extraction for field collected mosquitoes that maintains sample integrity. Here we present such a protocol that has presently been optimized for the study of <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Anopheles gambiae<\/span><span>, the primary vector of the malaria parasite <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Plasmodium falciparum. <\/span><span>All mosquitoes used in optimization were of the KEELE strain, insectary-raised, unfed, and stored in desiccant to mimic the preservation method generally used for entomological samples in malaria endemic areas. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol provides an automated DNA extraction method from dried mosquito thorax and\/or abdomen using the QIAcube HT instrument. The QIAcube HT is intended to perform automated, medium- to high-throughput purification of nucleic acids for molecular biology applications such as gDNA sequencing, qPCR of malaria parasite, target capture, etc. The QIAcube HT delivers high performance and reliability, enabling purification of high-quality nucleic acids from 8\u201396 samples per run. Yield is further maximized and efficiency increased through homogenization via TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) as compared to manual homogenization with pestles. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Genomic DNA quantity and quality was assessed via Qubit 1x dsDNA High Sensitivity quantification and Genomic DNA ScreenTape for the Agilent TapeStation 4150. For thoraxes (n=12), the average gDNA concentration was ~2.4 ng\/uL (range: 1.13-3.89 ng\/uL) while for abdomens (n=20) it was ~4.0 ng\/uL (range: 1.28-8.14) in an elution volume of 100 uL. While concentrations were outside the recommended ranges for the Genomic DNA ScreenTape (or sometimes outside the functional range) for the TapeStation DIN calculation, values ranged from 4-6 with fragment peaks around 7000-9000 bp for TissueLyser-homogenized samples. Attached are TapeStation, and Rmarkdown reports, and an Excel sheet containing the IDs and conditions of the samples in the run.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1593628586}
