This procedure aims to standardize the methodology in experiments conducted within a hypobaric chamber such as comparing normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia. This is important because current understanding of relationships between neurophysiological activity, and cerebrovascular and cardiorespiratory responses under varying environmental conditions remains limited. This procedure combines simultaneous neurophysiological, cardiorespiratory and cerebrovascular evaluations, allowing a comprehensive understanding of electro-neurophysiological activity. Our protocol requires an hour and a half of equipment setup, 1-1.5 hours of participant set-up, and 30 minutes of experimental data collection. Since multiple simultaneous physiological recordings, including EEG in this environment, can be fraught with pitfalls, we also provide practical considerations for experimental design and recording setup. Advanced knowledge of hypobaric chamber operation is required, alongside expertise in EEG and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.

Once this signal is given, the hypobaric chamber will immediately stop depressurization/pressurization and allow the participant another attempt to equalize. If the participant is unsuccessful in equalizing the chamber pressure will be adjusted to allow the participant to equalize the pressure in their ears before continuing with the pressurization/depressurization. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"2d8qo\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"8ba8i\",\"text\":\"Have the participant keep both feet planted on the ground.

Let them know that there is a risk of syncope (both hypoxic syncope or vasovagal syncope due to them sitting still and/or being nervous with the experiment) (Hanna, 2014; Westendorp et al., 1997) and go over the pre-syncope warning signs such as “seeing stars”, feeling lightheaded, vision starting to fade, suddenly feeling hot, and generally feeling unwell. Let the participant know to communicate any of these symptoms to the hypobaric chamber safety attendant immediately, at which point they will be given 100% oxygen to breathe, and the experiment terminated. Our experimental task has a break section every three minutes. During these breaks participants should flex/move their legs to minimise blood pooling to their legs and predisposing to a syncopal episode (Hanna, 2014). Advise the participant that in addition to criteria for stopping the test if they feel unwell, there are also physiological cut-offs (e.g., for our experiments we use SpO2 continuously below 80% and systolic blood pressure drop of 40 mmHg as cut-offs), that if exceeded will result in them being placed on 100% inspired oxygen as a safety precaution. It is important that the set up allows for the inside hypobaric chamber safety attendant to monitor the SpO2 and blood pressure to ensure compliance with any physiological cut points. Reassure the participant that they will still receive any study-related honoraria if the test is terminated because they meet safety endpoint criteria. This is important to prevent participants from attempting to conceal their symptoms for fear of jeopardising any honoraria or payments. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"sub\",\"offset\":1148,\"length\":1},{\"style\":\"sub\",\"offset\":1436,\"length\":1}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}"}
