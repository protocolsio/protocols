class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Obesity is considered one of the most important public health problems, making both treatment and prevention a priority (Di Cesare et al., 2016; Men\u00e9ndez et al., 2019). Over 1.9 billion adults are overweight, of these, 650 million are characterized as obese. A concerning factor regarding these numbers is that overweight, obesity, and associated risk factors present a strong association with the incidence of morbidity and mortality. The main strategies to reduce the incidence of obesity and overweight include adequate dietary intake and engagement in regular physical activity, at least 150 minutes spread over most days of the week, seeking negative energy balance (WHO, 2017). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Systematic reviews with meta-analyses have demonstrated the benefits of walking, as predominantly aerobic activity, considering the sum of daily steps or especially in the form of periodized exercise. Walking\/running benefits occur at the level of physical fitness with the prevention of cardiovascular disease risk (Hamer and Chida, 2008), weight control and loss (Richardson et al., 2008), as well as decrease of resting blood pressure and body fat (Murphy et al., 2007). Daily locomotion in an uncontrolled environment presents several challenges regarding the slope of the terrain, as well as the possibilities of increasing the slope of the surface in a controlled environment, such as on the treadmill (Lay et al., 2006). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Walking\/running on a sloped surface requires adjustments in muscular recruitment and activation when compared to situations on level ground surfaces, which can result in differences in metabolic cost and biomechanical parameters (Kimel-Naor et al., 2017). In positive slopes, there is an increase in the magnitude and duration of the activity, which suggests that the muscular activation pattern may help to predict the increased metabolic cost, considering that in this condition there is a predominance of concentric contractions of propulsive muscles (Silder et al., 2012). On moderate positive slopes (3 \u2013 9\u00b0) and at relatively slow walking speeds (0.5 \u2013 1.0 m.s<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">-1<\/span><span>) obese individuals can meet the recommended requirements for physical activity levels, which, in metabolic terms, is equivalent to walking on level terrain at higher speeds. For example, obese adults walking at 0.75 m.s<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">-1<\/span><span> and 6\u00b0 slope are at an intensity of approximately 52% of VO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2peak<\/span><span>, whereas walking on level terrain at 1.50 m.s<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">-1<\/span><span>, the intensity is approximately 50% of VO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2peak<\/span><span> (Ehlen et al., 2011).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Walking on a moderate positive slope can significantly reduce the risk of musculoskeletal and joint diseases in obese adults, due to the decrease of loads and joint movements when compared to walking on level terrain. Therefore, walking on moderate positive slopes and at relatively slow speeds can be a suitable form of physical activity in mechanical and energetic terms for obese adults to reach the recommended level of energy expenditure (Ehlen et al., 2011; Browning et al., 2013). Previous studies demonstrated that a positive slope favors the decrease of joint impact in eutrophic and obese individuals (Browning, 2012; Strutzenberger et al., 2017). However, no studies were found evaluating the joint impact of walking on a negative slope in obese people, but only speculations that this type of exercise may promote greater joint impact than walking on level terrain (Browning et al., 2013). There is a relationship between negative inclination, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and walking speed, in which at the same absolute speed compared to walking on level ground, the rating of RPE is lower, mainly due to the lower relative load (%VO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2max<\/span><span>) (Agarwal et al., 2017b), due to a higher proportion of negative W<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">mec<\/span><span>and its high efficiency (~100%) (Minetti et al., 1993). However, under the same relative load, which represents greater absolute speeds in the negative slope, no studies were found confirming or rejecting the hypothesis of lower RPE in this condition. Unlike the positive slope, in the negative slope, there is a predominance of eccentric contractions (Minetti et al., 1993), which are used as a strategy in clinical practice for eccentric activities (Geremia et al., 2019).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Another system presenting specific responses to the type of muscular contraction during exercise is the cardiovascular. Through a non-invasive Signal-Morphology impedance device, hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) can be accurately measured. It is speculated that in predominantly eccentric activities, such as walking on a negative slope, there is less overload on this system. This response can be attributed to the smaller amount of muscle mass used, under the same relative load, when compared to a predominantly concentric muscular activity, which represents lower recruitment and firing rates of motor units (Agarwal et al., 2017a). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>To our knowledge, the study of Browning et al. (2013) was the pioneer in the research on walking on negative slope of obese adults, in which the authors verified that, at a 3\u00b0 negative slope and at a speed of 1.25 m.s<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">-1<\/span><span>, obese individuals can reach an intensity level close to 40% of VO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2peak<\/span><span>, suggesting that this slope condition can be a good alternative for moderate intensities of physical exercise. The authors suggest that future studies with greater samples, control group, standardized measurements, and walking protocols are needed to improve the results found. Besides, speed is one of the critical points of the comparison analysis between different slopes, because if the absolute speed is the same at different inclinations, the relative intensity will be different. No studies were found developing a robust methodology to compare mechanical and energetic outcomes in different slopes, but in the same relative intensity, that is, iso-intensity (for example, speeds referring to the first ventilatory threshold (VT1), and second ventilatory threshold (VT2)).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>To answer some of these questions, it is necessary to conduct an integrative analysis between biomechanics and physiology of locomotion, named Locomotion Physiomechanics (Peyr\u00e9-Tartaruga and Coertjens, 2018). According to a classic study, a better understanding of the metabolic outcomes\u2019 behavior must be accompanied by biomechanical analysis. Muscle mechanical work (W<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">mec<\/span><span>) can be estimated through kinematic analysis and is basically divided into two parts: 1) external Wmec (W<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">ext<\/span><span>) which considers the work performed to elevate and accelerate the center of mass (CM) concerning the environment and 2) internal Wmec (W<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">int<\/span><span>), which considers the work performed to accelerate the body segments in relation to the CM. These variables, when analyzed together, can provide important information on how the locomotor machinery and the pendulum system are working to generate the energy needed to perform the task, including at different types of slope, which helps us to understand the main mechanisms associated with energy expenditure. To our knowledge, no studies have yet been conducted seeking a comparison of iso-intensity at different slopes measuring the locomotion physiomechanics, especially energy expenditure, to verify if there are differences caused by the type of slope. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The objective of the present study is to propose a form of walking\/running protocol that is capable of evaluating energy expenditure at different types of slopes (-5, 0, +5%), considering the same relative intensities (iso-intensity conditions, at VT1 and VT2 relative speeds), as well as to assess biomechanical and hemodynamic factors that may be associated.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1132276,"guid":"C377C2B0760211EBAE772DBD6A591A78","previous_id":1132275,"previous_guid":"ACE43060760211EBAE772DBD6A591A78","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"BE518D02E93C47FFB2875B31B64D7748","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Introduction"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"4314CAE7FA084284AA72D85BFA9A8BC4","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"687862D0760B11EBAE772DBD6A591A78","order_id":2,"type_id":28,"title":"equipment","source":{"brand":"Vicon","sku":"003125","specifications":"by six infrared cameras, accompanied by Nexus software (v. 1.8.2).","can_edit":false,"name":"VICON Motion Capture System","type":"Motion Capture System","link":"https:\/\/www.vicon.com\/hardware\/","file":null,"image":null}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"F628C670760A11EBAE772DBD6A591A78","order_id":3,"type_id":28,"title":"equipment","source":{"brand":"Cosmed","sku":"US Patent 9581539","specifications":"The K5 uses the latest technology, including COSMED's 4th generation opto-electronic reader and proven and reliable highly linear and rapid response O2 (GFC) and CO2 (NDIR) sensors.","can_edit":false,"name":"K5 Portable Metabolic System","type":"Portable Metabolic System","link":"https:\/\/www.cosmed.com\/en\/products","file":null,"image":null}},{"id":1054727,"guid":"51E44D90760611EBAE772DBD6A591A78","order_id":4,"type_id":28,"title":"equipment","source":{"brand":"General Electric","sku":"856-9","specifications":"Lunar Prodigy model, General Electric Company","can_edit":false,"name":"Lunar Prodigy","type":"Dual-Energy X-Ray absorptiometry","link":"https:\/\/www.gehealthcare.com.br\/products\/bone-and-metabolic-health","file":null,"image":null}},{"id":1054728,"guid":"3A80DD90760511EBAE772DBD6A591A78","order_id":5,"type_id":28,"title":"equipment","source":{"brand":"Instor","sku":"784426-8","specifications":"three-dimensional load cells with low-pass and second-order filter with a cut-off frequency of 30Hz.

The primary outcome is energy expenditure concerning slopes and speeds and the secondary outcomes are the mechanical work, mean GRF, and hemodynamic aspects. The data will be described by the mean and standard error values. The interactions between slopes and speeds will be tested with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) and Bonferroni post-hoc, adopting a significance level (\u03b1) of 0.05. Also, effect sizes (ES) will be calculated. The energy expenditure should be greater on the positive slope at all speeds. Higher production of positive mechanical work is expected on the positive slope and the impact peaks should be less in this condition.
