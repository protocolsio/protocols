The best outcome for children with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) depends on recognizing the symptoms and signs of metabolic diseases, promptly assessing them, and transferring them to a medical center familiar with the evaluation and treatment of related diseases. Delayed diagnosis may lead to Acute metabolic decompensation, progressive nerve damage, or death.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1606391595}
