With disease progression, epigenetic silencing of HLTF in primary CRC tumors coincides with negligible HLTF expression in the TME. Cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) models were developed to test the hypothesis that HLTF-deletion in cancer cells with resultant metabolic reprogramming—a hallmark of metastasis—is a prototypical example of cancer cells modifying their metabolic requirements in response to HLTF-deletion in the TME. The two metabolic pathways that derive energy from glucose—glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)—are variously utilized by cancer cells depending upon the TME. HIF-1α, a master regulator of glycolysis, was eliminated from a role in reprogramming metabolism to satisfy CDX energetic requirements by RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics. Variability in the gut microbiome, with a putative role in altered metabolism, was also eliminated. In contrast, HLTF-deleted cancer cells recovered from DNA damage at a transcriptomic level induction of DNA repair and OXPHOS genes linked to an amoeboid-associated phenotype at the tumor border (confocal microscopy).HLTF-deleted cancer and endothelial cells of the intravascular niche in the TME share a site-specific protein S-glutathionylation signature (2D DIGE, MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry) for three glycolytic enzymes (PGK1 Cys379/380, PGAM1 Cys55, ENOA1 Cys119) that diverted glycolysis in support of continued glutathione biosynthesis. The collective absence of HLTF/Hltf from tumor and TME maintained redox homeostasis throughout the CDX and promoted metastasis.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":22,\"length\":35},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":58,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":227,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":280,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":392,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":582,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":780,\"length\":6},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":1067,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":1271,\"length\":4},{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":1629,\"length\":9},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":1492,\"length\":7},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":1510,\"length\":2},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":1523,\"length\":3}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"","document":"","documents":[],"doi":"dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.ewov1oe37lr2/v1","doi_status":1,"ethics_statement":null,"fork_id":null,"fork_info":null,"forks":[],"funders":[{"funder_name":"Harry Weitlauf Endowment for Cancer Research","grant_id":""},{"funder_name":"TTUHSC Cancer Animal Facility Core, PI Dr. Scott L.

These two gels provided information on the difference in glutathionylation between cells and tumor (glutathionylation ratio). Difference in protein levels between the two samples (ratio) was determined by comparing Cy2 labeled cell proteins with Cy3 labeled tumor proteins by 2D DIGE (gel 3). The final glutathionylation ratio for each spot was obtained by adjusting the glutathionylation ratio by the protein ratio. 2D-DIGE guided the excision of 61 spots. Protein identification was based on peptide fingerprint mass mapping (using MS data) and peptide fragmentation mapping (using MS/MS data). MASCOT search engine was used to identify human and mouse proteins from primary sequence databases (SWISSProt).
