What gets noticed, and the manner of its documentation, is the result not only of what is available to the fieldworker occupying a particular positionality in the field, but of choices made about what counts as notice-worthy and what documentary forms best translate empirical phenomena into evidence. As a primarily individual enterprise, ethnographic fieldworkers forgo the benefits of collaboration that is a feature of work at other levels of disciplinary engagement. For example, anthropologists are very likely to discuss the results of their analysis in journals or at conferences, but far less likely to seek dialogue on the choices they are making while in the field itself. Enabling such dialogues allows ethnographers to reflexively attend to their practices of noticing, and helps to unsettle the field of notice-worthy phenomena at the time of research. As a set of instructions for collaborative fieldwork, where participants help shape each other's actions and engagements with/in the field, this protocol is structured as an iterative game capable of being played by fieldworkers spread out around the world. In being collaborative \\u0026 playful, this game fosters intimate relations that operate during our otherwise often lonely \\u0026 solitary fieldwork experiences. In the game, a set of specific and limited fieldwork instructions circulates amongst players. In the spaces for provocation and discussion which are opened up between fieldworkers as a result of these circulations, the protocol allows ethnographers to attend to the formation of their empirical habits in situ, to make explicit the means by which their habits of noticing give way to evidentiary data, and to nurture shared relations between ethnographers. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"","document":"","documents":null,"doi":null,"doi_status":0,"ethics_statement":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"ddhk\",\"text\":\"If you choose to conduct your playful fieldwork with human subjects, you must clear your research design and purpose with an approved Ethics Certificate for Human Subject Research.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","fork_id":null,"fork_info":null,"forks":[],"funders":[{"funder_name":"SSHRC (Social Science and Humanities Research Council) Partnership Development Grant","grant_id":" 890-2021-0114"}],"groups":[],"guid":"0E18215F37564DB8B9C8361521AC3589","guidelines":"","has_references":true,"has_step_reagents":false,"has_versions":false,"id":99215,"image":{"source":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_source":null,"placeholder":"https://www.protocols.io/img/default_protocol.png","webp_placeholder":null},"image_attribution":"","in_trash":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_contact_suspended":false,"is_content_confidential":false,"is_content_warning":false,"is_doi_reserved":false,"is_in_pending_publishing":false,"is_in_transfer":false,"is_owner":true,"is_research":true,"is_retracted":false,"is_shared_directly":false,"is_subprotocol":null,"is_unlisted":false,"item_id":1245171,"journal":null,"journals":[],"keywords":"Play,Ethnography,collaborative fieldwork,fieldnotes,anthropology,reflexive analysis,methodologies","last_modified":1714759517,"link":"https://www.emergematrix.org","location":null,"manuscript_citation":"","materials":[],"materials_text":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"kqbk\",\"text\":\"This is less a materials needed page and more a materials provided section.
