Here, we describe a noninvasive method to investigate vagal nerve involvement in GES therapy in human subjects.We have developed transcutaneous recording of cervical vagal activity that is synchronized with GES in conscious subjects, along with methods of discriminating the activity of different nerve fiber groups that are activated.We are refining the system of recording and analysis so that it can be applied in the clinic.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">New Method<\/span><span>: Sixty-six adults receiving GES therapy (Medtronic Enterra I\/II) to treat refractory nausea and vomiting secondary to diabetic, idiopathic, or postoperative GP were enrolled in the study (IRB #:1206008988). Subjects completed a GCSI symptom survey upon enrollment. The left and right cutaneous vagal electroneurograms (vENG) were collected from the skin surface over the left and right cervical vagal nerves, respectively, without changing the prescribed GES parameters. The mean response to GES was computed for each subject and classified according to the Letter System for nerve fiber classification. Symptom scores were compared between groups of subjects with or without significant Ab, Ag, Ad, or B fiber responses, defined as volleys in the mean response to GES whose peak amplitude is significantly different from 0 V ata=0.05. Nerve responses were correlated with GP symptoms.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Results<\/span><span>: Of the 66 subjects, 28 had diabetic GP (type 1:9; type 2:19), 35 had idiopathic GP, and 3 had postsurgical GP. Stimulus pulse current and charge did not predict treatment efficacy, but did predict a significant increase in total symptom score in type 1 diabetics as GES stimulus charge per pulse increased (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p <\/span><span>< 0.01), representing a notable side effect and providing a method to identify it. In contrast, the number of significant left and right vagal fiber responses that were recorded was directly related to patient symptom improvement.Increased vagal responses correlated with significant decreases in total symptom score (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p <\/span><span>< 0.05). Taken together, our analysis suggests that it is possible to extract meaningful information pertaining to vagal activity with noninvasive electrodes and that specific fiber response profiles predict improvements in specific symptoms of gastroparesis.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusions<\/span><span>: Cutaneous vagal CNAP analysis is a useful technique to unmask relationships among GES parameters, vagal recruitment, efficacy and side-effect management. Our results suggest that CNAP-guided GES optimization will provide the most benefit to patients with idiopathic and type 1 diabetic GP, especially when tuned for left vagal Ag and right vagal Ad\/B fiber responses. The possible side effects associated with left vagal Abactivation in type 1 diabetics underscore the need to consider disease etiology and fiber recruitment profiles in the patient and parameter selection process.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Funding Acknowledgment<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This work is supported, in part, by NIH SPARC OT2OD028183 and NIH SPARC OT2OD023847.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Publication\/Abstract Reference:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>[1] Ward M.P., Rajwa B., Wo J.M.,\u00a0Gupta A.,\u00a0Furness J.B., Powley T.L., and T.V.
