In general, each position in the sequence trace is represented by one predominant nucleotide signal indicative of the actual nucleotide. The minor signals from the other three nucleotides are normally considered as background. In TIDE(R) the percentage of these aberrant nucleotides is plotted along the sequence trace of the control and the experimental sample. Thus, a value of 0% at a position indicates that the detected nucleotide does not differ from the control sequence while a value of 100% indicates that the expected nucleotide was not detected at all (and instead only one or more of the other three nucleotides) (Fig. 2b). The percentages of aberrant nucleotides in the control should be low along the whole sequence trace. However, the experimental sample consists of a mixture of multiple sequences due to the presence of indels and possible point mutations. Around the break site the sequences start to deviate from the control, which is visible with consistently elevated signal of the aberrant sequence signal. Note that there is a 25% chance that an identical nucleotide in a mutated sequence is found as is present in the control sequence at the same position, because there are only 4 different nucleotides available. This plot allows the user to visually inspect the sequence deviation caused by the targeted nuclease and enables to verify the alignments and quality of the data.

However, the efficiency and the type of introduced mutations by the genome editing method are largely dependent on the target site. As a consequence, the outcome of the editing operation is difficult to predict. Therefore, a quick assay to quantify the frequency of mutations is vital for a proper assessment of genome editing actions. We developed two methods that are rapid, cost-effective, and readily applicable: (1) TIDE, which can accurately identify and quantify insertions and deletions (indels) that arise after introduction of double strand breaks (DSBs); (2) TIDER, which is suited for template-mediated editing events including point mutations. Both methods only require a set of PCR reactions and standard Sanger sequencing runs. The sequence traces are analyzed by the TIDE or TIDER algorithm (available at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/tide.nki.nl\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">https:\/\/tide.nki.nl<\/span><\/a><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\"> <\/span><span>or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/deskgen.com\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">https:\/\/deskgen.com<\/span><\/a><span>). The routine is easy, fast, and provides much more detailed information than current enzyme-based assays. TIDE and TIDER accelerate testing and designing of DSB-based genome editing strategies.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617679}
