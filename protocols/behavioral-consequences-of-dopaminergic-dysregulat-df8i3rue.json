For quality assessment, prospective design, ascertainment of exposure, ascertainment of outcome, and control for confounding will be evaluated. To summarize the studies that are obtained, a narrative review of the association between violence-induced trauma and dopamine activation will be performed. The studies will be categorized according to the following categorization criteria: baseline vs. stimulus-induced and acute vs. chronic effects.
