Use the green PPE glove.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Repeat microwaving in increments until you hear the tinkling sounds. Keep repeating until the agarose is completely dissolved (it will not look like there are clear granules in the liquid).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Let the flask cool after microwaving (you may run water over the flask to cool it faster). It should cool to about 50 degrees C before you pour it. The flask shouldn\u2019t be painful to the touch.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Ensure that the gel casting tray is clean and dry. It may be cleaned with DI water if dirty. Never use bleach or ethanol to clean the acrylic.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Ensure that the gel container is oriented so that the current will run from black to red.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Check that the gel container is level using the rounded level.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Ensure that the gel casting tray is oriented so that the seals are against the walls of the gel container.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Pour the gel from the flask into the casting tray. Use a pipette tip to remove any bubbles.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Include 2 gel combs in the notches in the tray. Note: the combs have different volume sizes and amount of wells on each side, so be sure to pick the well volume and number of wells you want.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 The gel takes 1.5 to 2 hours to fully solidify. It can be checked intermittently during this time, and will turn opaque when solid and dry.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Turn the gel casting tray so that the well contents will flow from black to red. If oriented from red to black, the bands will just fall off of the gel into the buffer. Pour buffer so that it is touching the electrodes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Once buffer is covering everything, the combs may be taken out. Be careful not to rip the gel. Pull the combs directly upwards.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Filling Wells<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Materials:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">SYBR green (In freezer)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Loading dye<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Ladder 100 BP (fridge)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Approximately 6 inches of parafilm<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">10 uL pipette and tips<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Procedure:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Beforehand, mix 300 uL SYBR green with 600 uL loading dye and keep in freezer.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Centrifuge the PCR products and then put in a frozen rack. Centrifuge SYBR green mixture and put in the larger frozen rack wrapped in aluminum foil. It is light sensitive.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Add SYBR green mixture in dots on the parafilm, with 2 uL of the mixture per dot. You will need the amount of dots for your number of samples plus 1 for the ladder. (8 dots for 5 beetles, a negative and positive control, and the ladder).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Add 6-8 uL of ladder in the first dot only, and pull the liquid up and down in the pipette tip to mix. Note: if electrophoresing two rows of wells, it can be helpful to put a ladder in the first well of the second row as well as the first.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Add 6 uL of each PCR product in each of the other dots and mix up and down in the pipette tip (It is important at this point to make sure you know what order your samples are in).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Set the pipette to 9.5 uL and pull the first dot up with the pipette. Be careful not to introduce air bubbles. Add the liquid to the first well as vertically as possible, and being careful not to touch the gel. Don\u2019t press the pipette button down the second half of the way so that air bubbles are not introduced. It is better to leave a very small amount of PCR product in the tip than to introduce bubbles.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Repeat this with each of the dots into each of the wells.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Slide the lid onto the gel container.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Plug the red cord into the red outlet, and the black cord into the black outlet on the machine.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Turn the machine on, and put on 100 volts for 45 minutes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Take a photo of the gel within 10 minutes after it finishes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Gel Photos Procedure:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Take the gel casting tray out of the gel container and place it into the tray of the Enduro machine. Make sure everything on the machine is closed, because it emits UV light to take the photo.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Open the Enduro GDS software on the computer, and click capture image, then click illuminate. This should make the gel with bands visible. You can adjust the illumination to make the bands more visible. Once done adjusting, you can take a photo.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Take the gel casting tray out of the machine, making sure the UV is off first.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u2022 Gel can be thrown away, and the gel casting tray can be cleaned with DI water.
