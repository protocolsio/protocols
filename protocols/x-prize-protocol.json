The test method is based on ArcDia TPX technology (references). ArcDia TPX allows separation-free detection in bioaffinity binding reactions, such as immunometric sandwich assays.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">The TPX technique employs polymer microparticles as solidphase carriers for bioaffinity binding reactions. The microparticles have been coated with a primary antibody, which recognizes the antigen. Fluorescently labeled secondary antibody is the other reagent component. Upon addition of a sample, which contains the antigen(SARS-CoV-2), three component immunocomplexes (sandwich) are formed on the microparticles according to the immunometric binding principle (sandwich assay).<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The microbeads become fluorescent as the immunocomplexes binds to it. The fluorescence from individual microbeads are recorded as they pass the focal point of the microfluorometer (mariPOC analyzers AD-070). mariPOC analyzer generates fluorescence by means of two-photon excitation [110]. Two-photon excitation is charaterized with high spatial resolution, which allows differentiation of the specific bioaffinity fluorescence (from the microbeads) and from the background fluorescence of the continuous phase<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Control and Calibration<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">mariPOC test system is automated. The test system interprets the results of the control samples automatically on behalf of the end-user. The test system notifies the end-user whether the control sample returned an acceptable or failed result. In case the analyzer returns a failed result, the operator shall contact the technical support of the supplier, who shall sort out the root cause of the failure. The mariPOC software monitors the data of control samples throughout the history of the analyzer and stores the last 60 days of controls on the machine. This history data provides valuable information of the health of the mariPOC analyzer. The software algorithm and the acceptance criterion of control samples are confidential information of the manufacturer and are disclosed to the FDA only upon request. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The function of the mariPOC test system is monitored by a weekly analysis of the multianalyte control samples (positive control and negative control). Controls are provided by the manufacturer with the test kit. One positive control sample includes control material for all analytes of a particular test application. Control samples are not used to calibrate the system. The test system is calibration free. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The mariPOC software gives an automated pop-up reminder when one week has passed since the last run of control samples for the corresponding test plate type. The reminder includes instructions on handling a control sample (see user manual Figure 37). If the reminder window is closed without analyzing the control samples, a new reminder will appear until both positive and negative controls have been run. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Control samples are stored in foil bags at 2-8 C. One bag contains a positive control sample tube and a negative control sample tube. Control sample tubes are bar coded thus recognized by the analyzer. The concentration of positive control material represents the analyte concentration of low-positive samples.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Stability<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Shelf life stability test are ongoing for mariPOC SARS CoV2.
