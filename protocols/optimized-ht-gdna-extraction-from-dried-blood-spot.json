infectious diseases surveillance, genomic epidemiology studies of targeted pathogens, and Biobanking. In particular, DBS samples are routinely collected during cross-sectional and large-scale epidemiological studies (i.e. Malaria Indicator Survey) in malaria-endemic countries for malaria surveillance and genomic studies. DBS samples have multiple advantages over venous blood, including less invasive sample blood collection (finger prick) and the recommended short- and long-term storage at room temperature, which facilitates sample transportation (domestically or internationally).
