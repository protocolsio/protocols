The mobile phase consisted of A: 0.1% formic acid in water and B: 0.1% formic acid in ACN, pumped at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min-1. The starting conditions of 3% B were kept static for 0.1 minutes, before initialising the linear gradient utilised to elute and separate the peptides over 7.7 minutes to 40% B. B was thereafter linearly increased to 80% over 0.2 minutes and held for 1 minute to wash the column before returning to the initial conditions followed by equilibration for 1 minute prior to the subsequent injection. The LC system was coupled to a Waters Xevo-TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection in positive electrospray ionisation mode. The capillary voltage was set to 2.8 kV, the source temperature to 150 \u00b0C, the desolvation temperature to 600 \u00b0C, the cone gas and desolvation gas flows to 150 and 1000 L hour-1 respectively.
