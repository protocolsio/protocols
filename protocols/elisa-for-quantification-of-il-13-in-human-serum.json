They play essential roles in the activation and differentiation of immune cells, as well as proliferation, maturation, migration, and adhesion. They also have pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary function of interleukins is, therefore, to modulate growth, differentiation, and activation during inflammatory and immune responses. Interleukins consist of a large group of proteins that can elicit many reactions in cells and tissues by binding to high-affinity receptors in cell surfaces. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>CD4+T cells (Th2), NKT cells and mast cells synthesize IL-13. It acts on monocytes, fibroblasts, epithelial cells and B cells. The IL-13 significant effects are B-cell growth and differentiation, stimulates isotype switching to IgE. It causes increased mucus production by epithelial cells, increased collagen synthesis by fibroblasts and inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Also, IL-13 works together with IL-4 in producing biologic effects associated with allergic inflammation and in defense against parasites. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK499840\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">[1]<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Reference<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>1.
