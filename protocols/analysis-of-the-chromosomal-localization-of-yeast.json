A powerful method for investigating proteins within a native chromatin environment in the cell is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Combined with the recent technological advancement in next generation sequencing, the ChIP assay can map the exact binding sites of a protein of interest across the entire genome. Here we describe a-step-by step protocol for ChIP followed by library preparation for ChIP-seq from yeast cells.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1632310868}
