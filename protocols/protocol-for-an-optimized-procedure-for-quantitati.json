Likewise, if using a viability stain, a relevant mtKeima+ viability FMO control population should be included to ensure accurate gating of viable cells.

We have found that CCCP can induce high levels of fluorescence, particularly in the lysosomal channel between control and stimulated populations. Therefore, it is crucial to set voltages using both stimulated and unstimulated controls, as well as relevant single-stained samples, in order to ensure sufficient voltage to acquire data, but not set so high as to force the majority of mtKeima+ events off-scale. We recommend the use of linear axes when determining voltages for the violet 405nm and yellow\/green 561nm lasers used with the mtKeima plasmid. Unlike logarithmic or biexponential axes,linear axes facilitate the visualization of more subtle differences in fluorescence, at the expense being able to capture disparate populations. However, unlike antibody staining of distinct cell populations, fluorescent differences are comparatively minor in the mtKeima assay, and as such non-linear axes can collapse and obscure relevant population differences. Once voltages have been determined in an initial experiment, we recommend using calibration particles (Spherotech, URCP-38-2K) at the beginning of each flow-cytometry session to ensure voltages are consistent (+\/- 10%) across previous replicates.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054727,"guid":"607C825E06404DE9841C2852EF466BAC","order_id":4,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">ATTENTION: <\/span><span>Traditionally, flow cytometers rely on algorithms to clearly separate populations when there is an overlap between distinct signals from different fluorochromes, in a process known as compensation. This requires the use of compensation controls, which are usually single-stained cells or beads, that facilitate the calculation of compensation values. However, in the case of mtKeima, as both YG610 and V605 emissions are encoded on the same plasmid, it is impossible to create the necessary single-positive compensation controls. Thus, if mtKeima is to be combined with other stains, compensation must be calculated manually. Alternatively, if mtKeima is used in conjunction with only one additional stain, such as a viability marker, it is simpler to use uncompensated data with the viability stain in a distinct laser line. We recommend using a far-red stain to decrease autofluorescence. However, it is still necessary to verify that there is minimal overlap between the viability stain and mtKeima+ channels, prior to running samples.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":"

Select \u2018Export\/ Concatenate Group\u2019 from the menu options, a secondary window will appear titled \u2018Group: Export or Concatenate\u2019. In Flowjo 10.6 there are currently three export options; FCS, and two comma-separated values (CSV) options, CSV-channel and CSV-scale. As CSV is a spreadsheet format, select either of the CSV options from the drop-down menu. We opt to use CSV-scale values as it represents the uncompressed form of the data, however differences between channel and scale values are negligible for this analysis pipeline. It is still best to avoid alternating between formats across replicates. Next, select 20000 events to be exported by setting \u2018include no more than: 20000\u2019 in the include events option box. Then, under parameters select \u2018custom set of parameters\u2019.A secondary window will appear titled \u2018Custom Parameter Set\u2019. Within this dialogue box, select the lysosomal and cytosolic channels. After selecting \u2018OK\u2019 the dialogue box will close. Finally, click \u2018export\u2019.

Recently, the development of flow cytometry-based assays that utilize the fluorescent mtKeima reporter system have allowed for quantitative assessment of mitophagy at a single cell level. However, clear guidelines for appropriate flow cytometry workflow and downstream analysis are lacking, and studies using flow cytometry in mtKeima-expressing cells often display incorrect and arbitrary binary mitophagic or non-mitophagic cutoffs that prevent proper quantitative analyses. In this paper, we propose a novel method of mtKeima data analysis which preserves subtle differences present within flow cytometry data, in a manner that ensures reproducibility.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods Summary:<\/span><span>When used in conjunction flow cytometry, the fluorescent mtKeima reporter system facilitates the assessment of mitophagy at a single cell level. However, current experimental design and analysis methods inadequately capture biological shifts in measured cell populations. In this report, we propose an outline for the transfection of mtKeima into a cell monolayer, cell preparation and downstream analysis using flow cytometry and associated software, with emphasis on a novel data processing technique.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1594909041}
