These tests work by disturbing the individual's homeostasis in a controlled way to assess the body's responses to it. This is accomplished through physical stressors (Physiological or environmental), mental stressors (emotional or cognitive) or a mix of both [2]. To assess responses to these stressors, several biochemical (e.g. cortisol, interleukins, norepinephrine), physiological (e.g. heart rate variability, pupil size) and cardiovascular (e.g. blood pressure (BP), heart rate) markers are used [2], of which we will highlight the BP.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">    High BP is one of the main preventable factors associated with premature death globally [3] and is associated with the risk of cardiovascular events, strokes and kidney disease [4]. One of BP's control strategies is to perform physical exercises. It is known that even after a single exercise section, blood pressure levels can be below baseline levels at rest [5]but its influence on blood pressure levels under stress is still poorly understood. In a 2006 meta-analysis, Hamer and colleagues [6]evaluated the acute effects of aerobic exercise on BP under stress and found promising results. However, in addition to new studies being produced since then, responses to non-aerobic exercise are still unclear.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">    Thus, the objective of the review proposed here is to answer the following question: what are the acute effects of physical exercise on BP responsiveness to non-cardiopulmonary stress tests in adults?<\/div><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":968997,"guid":"70823220B70D11EAA08F0D8FAA5A8593","previous_id":968995,"previous_guid":"1E62A2E0B70D11EAA08F0D8FAA5A8593","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"30C2A76281BC40299D7BFB1C58B0A77C","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"30915582C9B84D1992B4EEDDE8432441","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">    <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Eligibility criteria<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>    Studies with the following characteristics will be eligible: <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1)Population<\/span><span>: Human, both sexes, adults; <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">2) Intervention<\/span><span>: Acute physical exercise session of any modality; <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3) Control<\/span><span>: Session without exercise; <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">4) Outcome of interest<\/span><span>: peak BP (Systolic, diastolic and\/or mean) during non-cardiopulmonary stress test or BP variation (values during stress minus basal BP); <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">5) Languages<\/span><span>: English, Portuguese and Spanish; <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">6) Study designs<\/span><span>: Randomized clinical trials, or balanced crossover; <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">7) Publication dates:<\/span><span> No time limit.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">    The exclusion criteria are: Literature reviews, meta-analysis, letters to the editor, observational studies, animal studies, studies in children, studies written in other languages not described above, studies whose exercise intervention is relaxation sessions, breathing exercises, stretching or cardiovascular rehabilitation after serious cardiovascular events, and studies that do not measure BP during the stress tests.<\/div><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":968998,"guid":"A29E6990B70D11EAA08F0D8FAA5A8593","previous_id":968997,"previous_guid":"70823220B70D11EAA08F0D8FAA5A8593","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"71385157949F4F09A1F8040DE414B0B2","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"12BB62F31B2A41B3BEDECF99F723E3AF","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">    <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Search strategy<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">    The searches will be carried out in digital databases (PUBMED, LILACS, EMBASE and Psycinfo), in the references of the main articles, and through manual search in the CORE and Google Scholar platforms.
