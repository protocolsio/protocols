While the sequence rules from positional scanning prove valuable in predicting TBMs, it should be noted that some of their aspects may be specific to the context of the 3BP2 TBM peptide , which positional scanning was performed on [7]. Whereas Arg and Gly at positions 1 and 6, respectively, are essential, other residues are important as well, with the exception of positions 2 and 3, which can likely be ignored since they do not contribute to binding and mainly fulfil spacing roles (Fig.1b, d).

Of note, a large or strongly charged amino acid at position 4 very likely disqualifies the TBM candidate as a genuine tankyrase binder. Furthermore, Asp and Glu at position 8 can compensate for unfavorable amino acids at other positions [7], as seen in one of the TBMs of AXIN1\/2, where a suboptimal Val at position 4 appears to be counterbalanced by a Glu at position 8 (Fig.1e) [7, 11]. Interestingly, a second TBM in AXIN1\/2 shows that the Arg, normally at position 1, can be placed further N-terminal, resulting in looping-out of the \u201cinserted\u201d residues (Fig.1c, e). Likewise, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF146 has been proposed to contain numerous atypical TBMs with a nonconventional positioning of the Arg [27], and it is possible that a distal Arg is required for weak binding of the TBM of GRB14 to tankyrase (Fig.1e) [7, 8, 28]. Thus, the possibility of a distal Arg residue should be taken into consideration. It is likely that such extended TBMs display a weaker affinity for tankyrase. Numerous tankyrase binders contain multiple TBMs, such as AXIN1\/2 [11] and MERIT40 [7] (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">see <\/span><span>below). Since avidity effects likely contribute to binding of these proteins to tankyrase, the affinity of some of these individual TBMs for the ARC may be lower, and this may be reflected in deviations from the \u201coptimal\u201d sequence.<\/span><\/div><br\/><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/eaz39nan.jpg\" \/><\/div><br\/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"E78781CA72AA403991FCF7673FB0D868","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/eaz39nan.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol is part of a collection: <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/private\/DA5F6F33163011EBAE360A58A9FEAC2A\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Identifying and Validating Tankyrase Binders and Substrates: A Candidate Approach<\/span><\/a><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) enzyme tankyrase (TNKS\/ARTD5, TNKS2\/ARTD6) uses its ankyrin repeat clusters (ARCs) to recognize degenerate peptide motifs in a wide range of proteins, thereby recruiting such proteins and their complexes for scaffolding and\/or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
