While there are good examples of nutritional care initiatives, implementing appropriate nutritional care remain a challenge. Managing malnutrition particularly with adult in-patients on admission or at risk of becoming malnourished requires multidisciplinary care; the hospital team plays a crucial role in ensuring these patients\u2019 nutritional needs are met. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The review aims to identify the evidence with specific focus on reported multidisciplinary coordination and collaboration excluding artificial nutritional support (enteral and parenteral nutrition)a domain where well-established evidence already exists.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Inclusion criteria: <\/span><span>The context is limited to the hospital setting with an adult in-patient population.
