The oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) capacity and the relative contribution of respiratory complexes I and II were determined, together with the coupling of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (coupling control ratio, CCR). The release of cytochrome C (shuttles electrons between complexes III and IV) was also determined, in parallel with biochemical and histopathological evaluation of the samples.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">Evaluation: With our protocol, we provided quantitative clinical data making RA and OA comparable with respect to mitochondrial dysfunction.
