Well log documents may be in poor condition (i.e. yellowed, torn, not legible) and can be scanned at slower speeds with a higher resolution, or may need information to be interpreted by hand with manually created digital headers and identifiers. Records with advanced degradation should be scanned as accurately as possible for future reference, and can then be disposed of. When handling water and mold damaged documents always wear personal protective equipment (PPE). A HEPA or N95 mask with rubber gloves is the minimum PPE required for personal safety and should be used in combination with non-ventilated eye googles and long sleeve clothing. Wash or dispose of clothing after use. Water and mold damaged documents should be kept away from other paper records to prevent mold from spreading, and after recording as much information as possible by high resolution photograph or partial scan, can be disposed of.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1220923,"guid":"37C269C0EDBA11EB90347DF4900C527A","previous_id":1210339,"previous_guid":"989BCC40E01E11EB9AE4276F0AE63DDF","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6DA976B402FA4077ACE04E26AEF34FA3","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Resources"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F933A93F72FE44DAA9A7728EF59621DA","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Crangle, R.D., Jr., 2007, Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files for geophysical wire line well logs and their application to geologic cross sections through the central Appalachian basin: United States Geological Survey Open File Report 2007-1142, 14 p.\u00a0\u00a0<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Trippi, M.H., and Crangle, R.D., Jr., 2009, Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files for geophysical (gamma ray) wireline well logs and their application to geologic cross section C-C\u2019 through the central Appalachian basin: U.S. Geological Survey Open File Report 2009-1021, 13 p., 20 LAS files.\u00a0<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Kansas Geological Survey.\u00a0(2013).\u00a0File Format Tools.\u00a0KGS.ku.edu.\u00a0http:\/\/www.kgs.ku.edu\/Magellan\/Elog\/tif_zip.html<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Pankaj et al..\u00a0(2017).\u00a0Preserving and Securing Legacy Well Log Data.\u00a0Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference, Abu Dhabi, UAE,\u00a02017(SPE-188475-MS),\u00a01-13<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/riojournal.com\/article\/67379\/instance\/6662388\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">https:\/\/riojournal.com\/article\/67379\/instance\/6662388\/<\/span><\/a><\/div><br\/><br\/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA9F6C","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1220925,"guid":"542D3180EDBA11EB90347DF4900C527A","previous_id":1220923,"previous_guid":"37C269C0EDBA11EB90347DF4900C527A","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"75A6FCC129E149BCA9076E5044071904","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Subtopics"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"DA321FA046BE4EE39E6C1C6787C50801","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Digital Scanning<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/core-science-systems\/national-geological-and-geophysical-data-preservation-program\/digital-1\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">https:\/\/www.usgs.gov\/core-science-systems\/national-geological-and-geophysical-data-preservation-program\/digital-1<\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">An outline of recommended practices for Well Log Digitization.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1632079216}
