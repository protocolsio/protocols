A CF will deflect and even attach to nearby surfaces due to air currents caused by its manual repositioning, movements in the room, and room ventilation, as well as electrostatic forces. The purpose of the fixture’s slot was to keep the samples anchored, yet elevated and separated to insulate, conformally, the individual Cu-CF assemblies with parylene in subsequent vapor-deposition steps. Standard microscope slides were also used successfully as fixtures where the CF tips were left unanchored and remained elevated vertically above the slide. However, this required greater spacing between Cu-CF assemblies in order to prevent neighboring CFs from contacting and adhering to each other, which would ultimately limit the total number of Cu-CF assemblies that could be placed in the chamber for parylene deposition.

A custom-made temperature-controlled dip-coater was used to coat the electrodes reproducibly with maltose. Nichrome (80% Ni, 19.5% Cr, 1.45% Si) wire (20G, Master Wire Supply) was coiled around a hollow ceramic tube. A thermistor was attached to the base of the tube to monitor the temperature of maltose inserted inside the tube, and then the base was sealed to prevent maltose from leaking using thermally-conductive epoxy (832TC, MG Chemicals). A solid-state relay was used to provide DC current (up to 1A) to the heating wire. An Arduino was programmed to switch the current on and off based on comparing the temperature measured from the thermistor to the set-point (110 – 120 °C). Maltose powder (M5885-100G, Sigma-Aldrich) was placed into plastic falcon tube vials and then submitted for gamma-irradiation sterilization (25 kGy, VPT Radiation Lab and Test Services). The CFET array and coiled heater were sterilized using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (Sterrad). The array was lowered into the tube and then maltose powder was poured into the heating tube, and heated until molten. The temperature was lowered by 2 – 5 °C to increase the viscosity and after a few minutes the array was lifted at a rate of 250 µm/s. This procedure produced a relatively uniform thickness of 1 – 2 mm around the bundle, but success was highly dependent on the volume of maltose inside the tube due to the non-uniform temperature distribution across the coil. Alternatively, we also employed a manual coating method for the CFET array. We first melted maltose powder on a hot plate over which CFET array was placed and rapidly lifted to produce a relatively uniform coating of 1 – 3 mm diameter.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":84912,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"9","cases":[],"critical":null}],"template_id":1,"title":"Design
