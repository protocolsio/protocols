In order to obtain a 10% FCS solution, 45mL of -SVF solution was added to a tube and then topped up with 5mL of pure FCS.\\nCell preparation.White adipocytes cell line was used. \\nThe ampoules containing the cells were maintained in liquid nitrogen (-80˚C) then thawed in a water bath at 37˚C.

The medium was then renewed every 48 hours to optimize cell proliferation.\\nAfter 6 to 7 days of culture, the cells occupy 80% of the surface of the flask, justifying a detachment of the cells by means of a treatment with trypsin to avoid inhibition of proliferation by contact and thus avoid distorting the results of the subsequent experiences.\\nDetachment of cells.The culture medium was removed using an aspiration syringe then 10 mL of PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) were added in order to eliminate the trypsin inhibitors present in the culture medium previously removed.

The amount of genetic material was estimated by measuring absorbance with the Nanodrop spectrophotometer. For that,1µLsamples were introduced at the level of the spectrophotometer and a concentration of total RNAs in the solution as well as the purity of the \\ntotal RNAs were obtained. A reverse transcription from2µgof total RNAs was then carried out.\\nThe purpose of this step is to synthesize cDNA (complementary DNA) of RNA in order to allow the polymerase \\nused in qPCR (Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) to bind to its substrate. To solutions containing2µgof \\nRNA, or0,2µg/µL of RNA, were added10µLof reaction mix.

The reverse transcription cycle started with 10 minutes at 25˚C in order to prepare the samples. Then, the samples were brought to 35˚C for 120 minutes, which allowed the hybridization of the primers and the synthesis of the cDNAs. Finally the samples were brought to 85˚C for 5 minutes in order to stop the synthesis and separate the primers.\\nQuantitative PCR reactions were then performed on the LightCycler® from Roche in 420-well microplates and using the ABsolut kitTMqPCR SYBR® Green Mixes (ABgene) in accordance with the supplier's instructions. To do this, a DNA intercalator, SYBR green, was used, which emits fluorescence in contact with double-stranded \\nDNA, with a maximum intensity at 550 nm. This fluorescence was detected and measured by the LightCycler microspectrofluorimeter®, which allowed quantification of the number of copies of the cDNA sequence of interest. At each end of the cycle, the fluorescence is therefore measured and it is possible to visualize the exponential increase in real time of the quantity of amplicons generated. Finally, the number of cycles necessary for the fluorescence of the target gene to be detectable is inversely proportional to the initial quantity of the mRNA of interest. This number of cycles was calculated and compared for a given gene between different conditions. The target sequences were amplified from specific primers and using polymerase activating at high temperature. For each sample, a reaction medium was prepared containing4,6µLof reaction mix (SYBR®Green, Taq (Thermus AQuaticus) polymerase, dNTP, enzyme buffer and MgCl2),2,2µLof cDNA diluted to the 20th,0,5µLto prime forward,0,5µLprimer reverse (both at 102µM) and 1,6µLsterile water.\\nThe reference gene used was actin, in order to verify that the variations in the number of cycles obtained for a gene of interest between different conditions were indeed due to a difference in the initial quantity of mRNAs of this gene and not to the presence of Taq polymerase inhibitors between two conditions or the fact \\nthat less genetic material was collected between two conditions.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":30}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"qrgd\",\"text\":\"DNA constructs for transfections in vivo.
