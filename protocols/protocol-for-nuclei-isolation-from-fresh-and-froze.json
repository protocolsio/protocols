However, the libraries are less complex (less UMI and genes per nucs) and saturation is reached early on. Arguably, I prefer to have an input of >20 ng when possible so for that I add at least 2-4 cycles to start with (note the range of cells input is quite wide for cell input, e.g. 200-6000 --> 12 cycles for 3' v3.1 and 2000-6000 --> 14 cycles for low RNA content cells in 5' v2). Data so far has been great with significantly complex libraries and not nearly as saturated in 3' v3.1 chemistry. For 5' v2 chemistry, we have used the same approach. It is indeed challenging to determine then number of cycles to use for samples of unknown cell composition. Since 10x Genomics kits do not come with enough reagents to run extra cycles in case you need to increase the yield, I rather do a few more cycles upfront and reduce the cycling at SI-PCR.
