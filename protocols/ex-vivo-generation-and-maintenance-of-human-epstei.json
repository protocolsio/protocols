EBV T cells generally display viral antigen-specificity, high cytolytic and inflammatory capacity, and when repeatedly sensitized to autologous EBV blasts, lack xeno- or alloreactivity. Thus, EBV T cells are of high utility for in vitro and in vivo studies involving human T cell transduction, e.g. of a CAR or TCR, or as responder cells for assaying the activity of T cell-specific immunomodulatory agents such as bispecific antibodies or BiTEs. EBV T cells have also been used clinically to treat EBV+ malignancies in several independently conducted studies. This protocol details the basic in vitro steps necessary to generate EBV T cells to supplement what is described in the expansive literature making use of these cells.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1624768641}
