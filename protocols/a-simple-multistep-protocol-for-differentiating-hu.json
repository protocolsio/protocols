class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Macrophages differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide an alternative new tool overcoming some of the limitations of existing models for human macrophages, such as human macrophage-like cell lines and primary monocyte-derived macrophages. A combination of different cytokines and growth factors can differentiate hiPSCs toward myeloid lineage. Here we describe a simple multistep protocol for differentiating hiPSCs into functional macrophages. This includes derivation of three germ-line containing embryoid bodies (EBs) from iPSCs, generation of myeloid precursors from EBs, and finally maturation of myeloid precursors into functional macrophages. Technical procedure and specific culture conditions associated with each of these steps are discussed in detail.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617611}
