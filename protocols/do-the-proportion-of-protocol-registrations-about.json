To evaluate how often researchers registered protocols about systematic reviews (SRs) outside PROSPERO in medical and biomedical sciences. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Methods. This study will be a meta-epidemiological study. We will include all the protocols about SRs in PROSPERO, 44 preprint severs, Protocols.io, ClinicalTrials.gov and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), OSF Registries since 2011. We will retrieve titles and its publication years and whether the theme of preprints is related with COVID-19. We will describe the proportion of SRs protocol registration in the platforms outside PROSPERO over the years. We will display the trends. We will also compare characteristics of random samples of SRs protocols registered on PROSPERO with those registered outside PROSPERO.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Ethics & Dissemination. This study does not need ethics approval. We registered this study protocol. We will publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and may present them at conferences. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Discussion. This study might clarify whether proportion of protocol registrations about systematic reviews to platforms outside PROSPERO in medical and biomedical sciences increase over the years and whether systematic reviewers need to search these data sources before conducting SRs.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Registration: Protocols.io<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1598693680}
