This study aims to examine the effectiveness of a weight reduction intervention based on caloric restriction, low-impact aerobics (LIA), and a resistance-training program in improving patients' anthropometric and biochemical indicators and the incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among youth with obesity. In all, 64 participants were introduced to an enhanced lifestyle counseling and dieting program (the diet group, or DG) or to enhanced lifestyle counseling, dieting, and a supervised physical training program (the diet and training group, or DTG). Individuals diagnosed with MetS were analyzed in this study (DG: N = 09; DTG: N = 14). Before and after the intervention, the participants' anthropometric measures and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were assessed. Following the interventions, significant improvements were noted in all anthropometric variables among all participants (p ≤ 0.001 for all). Significant differences were noted between groups in terms of body weight (p ≤ 0.05), waist circumference (WC; p ≤ 0.01), body mass index (BMI; p ≤ 0.05), fat percentage (F%; p ≤ 0.05), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; p ≤ 0.05). All MetS components also improved in both groups, and the most significant improvements were observed among the training group in terms of fasting blood glucose (FBG) level (p ≤ 0.05), triglyceride (TG) level (p ≤ 0.001), overall cholesterol (OC; p ≤ 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; p ≤ 0.05), and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-c; p ≤ 0.001).\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":[]},{\"key\":\"1eiha\",\"text\":\"Conclusion: A minor daily caloric restriction (of approximately 500 kcal) program could be an effective tool in combating MetS.
