The protocol was defined based on sports science literature, where the participants would be performing maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) trials at first, then taking a recovery break, then starting with a low-intensity task, and then gradually increasing the difficulty level. The protocol included a preparation stage, followed by initial measurements, a familiarisation session, and finally a performance session. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Thirty (17 males, 13 females) healthy participants of at least 18 years old with no history of injury to the upper limb and back were involved in this experiment. Participants were students or staff members of University of Hertfordshire or other volunteers from outside the university. The total duration of the experiment, including the set-up time for each participant, was normally 40-55 minutes. A questionnaire was given as part of the experiment. The participants were asked to fill in a part of the questionnaire at the beginning of the experiment. They were also requested to update the fatigue state in the questionnaire after finishing the experiment.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The electromyogram measurements were taken using an EMG acquisition device (g.USBamp amplifier) from g.tec medical engineering GmbH. The data acquisition parameters (sampling rate, channel selection and so on) of the device were configured using Simulink 2017b.Three EMG electrode channels were configured in bipolar mode with a sampling frequency of 1200Hz. Electromyogram (EMG) signals were collected from 3 upper limb muscles (Biceps Brachii, Anterior Deltoid, and Middle Deltoid) of the participants during a robotic interaction. EMG electrodes for Biceps Brachii muscles were connected to Ports 11-12 of g.USBamp amplifier, Frontal Deltoid muscles to Ports 13-14 and Middle Deltoid muscles to Ports 15-16. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The experiment set-up included the <\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">HapticMaster<\/span><span> robotic interface configured for a rowing task.  <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The tasks involved upper limb exercises, which simulated rowing, using a robot arm (HapticMaster robot) as directed by visual instructions on screen and audio cues.
