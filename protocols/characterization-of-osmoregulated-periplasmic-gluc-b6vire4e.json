Two micrograms of each reaction and unreacted input was injected directly onto a HyperSil Gold C-18 2.1mm x 150mm reversed phase chromatography column. Analytes were separated using an increasing gradient that consisted of 0.1% formic acid in LCMS grade water as buffer B and 0.1% formic acid in LCMS grade acetonitrile as buffer B. Due to the hydrophilic nature of glucans, the gradient began with a 2-minute acquisition at 100% buffer A with a rapid ramp to 100% buffer B by 15 minutes before returning to baseline conditions for the remainder of the 20 minute experiment. The Q Exactive was operated in positive ionization mode using a data dependent acquisition method. An MS1 scan was acquired at 140,000 resolution with a scan range of 150 to 1500 m/z. The three most abundant ions from each MS1 scan were isolated for fragmentation using a three-step collision energy of 10, 30 and 100 and the fragment scans were obtained using 15,000 resolution. Ions with unassigned charge states or more than 3 charges were excluded from fragmentation. To prevent repeat fragmentation any ion within 5 ppm mass deviation of the selected ion was excluded from additional fragmentation for 30 seconds.

Low mass OPGs of interest for this study were identified solely with the positivetop32142021  method. Higher mass and negative polarity ionization may be necessary for the characterization of alternate OPG specis.
