These pure single colonies were further analysed using biochemical tests (Indole, Citrate, Urease, Motility and Triple Sugar Iron Agar). The tests were done together with a control Shigella colony taken from the laboratory in order to make a comparison. A colony of the organism was then saved in a cryovial containing Nutrient Agar -70 \u00b0C. This was done per Shigella spp. found.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1598079312}
