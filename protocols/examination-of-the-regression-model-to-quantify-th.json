In this study, we investigated whether the JOABPEQ could be used to construct a regression model to quantify low back pain and lower limb symptoms in patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH). We reviewed 114 patients with LDH scheduled to undergo surgery at our hospital. We measured the degrees of 1) lower back pain, 2) lower limb pain, and 3) lower limb numbness using the visual analog scale before the surgery. All answers and physical function data were subjected to partial least squares regression analysis. The degrees of lower back and lower limb pain could be used as a regression model from the JOABPEQ and had a significant causal relationship with them. However, the degree of lower limb numbness could not be used for the same. Based on our results, the questions of the JOABPEQ can be used to multilaterally understand the degree of lower back pain and lower limb pain in patients with LDH. However, the degree of lower limb numbness has no causal relationship, so actual measurement is essential.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1608048362}
