Labeled probes were hybridized to Affymetrix miRNA Array 3.0 in UC Davis Genome Center Microarray Core Facility using the standard procedure (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The total data set included 73 Affymetrix miRNA 3.0 microarrays. Upon scanning of the hybridized and washed Chips, data was obtained in a set of Affymetrix data files (.cel, .arr, .jpg). <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1592421336}
