The tissue must remain frozen and cold during this entire process. Otherwise proceed to Step 3.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3)Place 20-50 mg frozen tissue or crushed tissue into a pre-chilled 2 ml Dounce containing 1 ml cold 1x HB (add 15 ul RiboLock per ml of1x HB and mix well).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4)Dounce with \u201cA\u201d loose pestle until resistance goes away (~10 strokes).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5)Place \u201cA\u201d pestle into beaker with sterile water to soak for cleaning later.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">a.Optional \u2013 If residual un-homogenized tissue makes it difficult to Dounce, filter homogenate through a pre-chilled 50 ml conical using a 70 um bucket-style cell strainer filter prior to using tight pestle \u201cB\u201d.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">6)Dounce with \u201cB\u201d tight pestle until resistance goes away (~20 strokes).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7)Place \u201cB\u201d pestle into beaker with sterile water to soak for cleaning later.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">8)Filter during transfer using a 40 um cell strainer (Fisher Scientific Cat: 22363547) and transfer homogenate to a pre-chilled 50 ml tube.

Do not aspirate more than 200 ul at this step as this can cause you to take too much of the 40% layer which sometimes contains debris.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">19)Dilute nuclei by adding 200 ul of wash buffer (1X PBS with 1.0% BSA and 0.2U\/\u00b5l RNase Inhibitor).Mix gently by pipetting.
