dextran-cross-linked agarose beads [26, 27], and 4\u00a0\u03bcm amino polystyrene beads [20]. In this method, 5.4\u00a0\u03bcm Cyto-Plex\u2122 carboxylated polystyrene bead sets are first converted to amino beads, and then to glutathione beads. We use standard practices with high concentrations of reagents to obtain a high glutathione site density on the beads. A high surface coverage of glutathione (GSH) enables robust capture of soluble GST fusion proteins [28]. The 12 Cyto-Plex\u2122 carboxyl bead sets are coded with 12 graded intensities of far-red fluorescence when excited at a fixed wavelength, which does not interfere with fluorescein or phycoerythrin fluorescence detection. We suggest the use of a centrifuge with a swinging-bucket rotor and slow deceleration for ease of removing 90% of the supernatant, without disturbing the beads, during the many centrifugations in this synthesis. All reactions are at room temperature. While the protocol below is written for Cyto-Plex\u2122 beads , we used an inexpensive (nonfluorescent) set of polystyrene carboxyl beads for pilot-testing our protocol for optimizing the synthetic conversion of carboxyl- to amino-functional groups on the beads, and subsequent coupling to glutathione (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">see <\/span><span style =

At high surface density (>1300 fluorophores\/\u03bcm<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>), fluorophores on a bead surface undergo self-quenching with increasing site occupancy [31]. It is therefore likely that the 1.0 million sites determined by the calibration beads are a lower limit. However, this measure is useful for tracking the useful shelf life of the beads.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":"","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","note":null,"link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054729,"guid":"2FB6CB3F8E0642719C8327220CD5015B","order_id":6,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/ea69bcasf.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":7560,"critical":[{"id":13,"title":"Pause point","icon":"PauseIcon"}],"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1078335,"guid":"94083A702AB011EB9A43E9E42495FF03","previous_id":1078332,"previous_guid":"38B0E5A02AB011EB9A43E9E42495FF03","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"27C3089062F547CC90450E60CA945F89","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.1 Synthesis of Glutathione Beads"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"EAD60391E0244CCA859AF494CEB24759","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">(Wash 1\/4): Wash beads in the storage buffer of your choice (reducing the concentration of glutathione from 20\u00a0mM to below 2\u00a0\u03bcM).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":7560,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1078336,"guid":"B92F7D402AB011EB9732BB47823B20A1","previous_id":1078335,"previous_guid":"94083A702AB011EB9A43E9E42495FF03","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"1952594BE3A54608A1A264BCFC45AFC4","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.1 Synthesis of Glutathione Beads"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"1858D9B0242A47999DE2934FDBBE8579","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">(Wash 2\/4): Wash beads in the storage buffer of your choice (reducing the concentration of glutathione from 20\u00a0mM to below 2\u00a0\u03bcM).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":7560,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1078337,"guid":"B9DEA9002AB011EB9732BB47823B20A1","previous_id":1078336,"previous_guid":"B92F7D402AB011EB9732BB47823B20A1","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"63AFAC2DE5464E2784A440D69DDD13DA","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.1 Synthesis of Glutathione Beads"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"4D5259E3C9A8424B8FA567072D75478B","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">(Wash 3\/4): Wash beads in the storage buffer of your choice (reducing the concentration of glutathione from 20\u00a0mM to below 2\u00a0\u03bcM).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":7560,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1078338,"guid":"BAA04B502AB011EB9732BB47823B20A1","previous_id":1078337,"previous_guid":"B9DEA9002AB011EB9732BB47823B20A1","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7C8FD8301BC04A879D7DF7ABFDFBA2F0","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.1 Synthesis of Glutathione Beads"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"BB5A2BC33E2142B29AA8E6B37DB99013","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">(Wash 4\/4): Wash beads in the storage buffer of your choice (reducing the concentration of glutathione from 20\u00a0mM to below 2\u00a0\u03bcM).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":7560,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Small, monomeric guanine triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases) are ubiquitous cellular integrators of signaling. A signal activates the GTPase, which then binds to an effector molecule to relay a signal inside the cell. The GTPase effector trap flow cytometry assay (G-Trap) utilizes bead-based protein immobilization and dual-color flow cytometry to rapidly and quantitatively measure GTPase activity status in cell or tissue lysates. Beginning with commercial cytoplex bead sets that are color-coded with graded fluorescence intensities of a red (700\u00a0nm) wavelength, the bead sets are derivatized to display glutathione on the surface through a detailed protocol described here. A different glutathione-<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S<\/span><span>-transferase-effector protein (GST-effector protein) can then be\u00a0attached to the surface of each set. For the assay, users can incubate bead sets individually or in a multiplex format with lysates for rapid, selective capture of active, GTP-bound GTPases from a single sample. After that, flow cytometry is used to identify the bead-borne\u00a0GTPase based on red bead intensity, and the amount of active GTPase per bead is detected using monoclonal antibodies conjugated to a green fluorophore or via labeled secondary antibodies. Three examples are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the effector-functionalized beads for measuring the activation of at least five GTPases in a single lysate from fewer than 50,000 cells.<\/span><\/div><br\/><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Section 3.1 'Synthesis of Glutathione Beads' from 'Small-Volume Flow Cytometry-Based Multiplex Analysis of the Activity of Small GTPases' <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/small-volume-flow-cytometry-based-multiplex-analys-bpssmnee\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">https:\/\/www.protocols.io\/view\/small-volume-flow-cytometry-based-multiplex-analys-bpssmnee<\/span><\/a><\/div><br\/><\/div>","changed_on":1630617661}
