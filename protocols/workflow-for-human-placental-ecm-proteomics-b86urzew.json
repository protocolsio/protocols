Approximately 100 mg of 3mm glass beads were used to mechanically agitate samples in a Bullet Blender (NextAdvance) prior to all cellular and ECM extraction steps. Protein concentration of each fraction for each sample was measured using A660 Protein Assay (Pierce™). Proteolytic digestion was carried out according to the FASP protocol1 with 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff filters (Sartorius Vivacon 500 #VN01H02) using 30 ug of protein resulting from each fraction.

Eight μL of each sample was injected into a 20 μL loop using the autosampler. The analytical column was then switched on-line at 400 nl/min over an in house-made 100 μm i.d. × 150 mm fused silica capillary packed with 2.7 μm CORTECS C18 resin (Waters; Milford, MA). LC mobile phase solvents consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (Buffer A) and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile (Buffer B, Optima™ LC/MS, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After 22 uL of sample loading at a maximum column pressure of 700 bar, each sample was separated on a 120-min gradient at a constant flow rate of 400 nL/min. The separation gradient for cell fractions consisted of 6% buffer B from 0 to 3 minutes, followed by a linear gradient from 6 to 42% buffer B from 3 minutes to 105 minutes. Linear gradients from 6 to 36% and 6 to 24% buffer B were utilized from 3 to 105 minutes for the sECM and iECM fractions, respectively. Gradient elution was followed by a linear increase to 55% buffer B from 105 to 110 minutes and further to 95% buffer B from 110 to 111 minutes. Flow at 95% buffer B was maintained from 111 minutes to 120 minutes to remove remaining peptides. Data acquisition was performed using the instrument supplied Xcalibur™ (version 4.5) software. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode. Each survey scan of m/z 375–1600 was followed by higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS (30% collision energy) using the standard AGC target and a 35 ms maximum injection time with an isolation width of 1.6 m/z. The orbitrap was used for MS1 and MS2 detection at resolutions of 120,000 and 50,000, respectively. Dynamic exclusion was performed after fragmenting a precursor 1 time for a duration of 45 sec. Singly charged ions were excluded from HCD selection. \",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"8p5om\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"9mgd3\",\"text\":\"Data processing\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":15}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"cart7\",\"text\":\"Fragmentation spectra were searched against the UniProt humanproteome database using the MSFragger-based FragPipe computational platform2.
