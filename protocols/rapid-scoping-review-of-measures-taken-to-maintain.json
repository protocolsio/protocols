Recent modelling of the indirect effects of the coronavirus pandemic in low- and middle-income countries has shown that under certain service reduction scenarios, reduced coverage of essential maternal and child health interventions can lead to additional maternal and child deaths. Governments need to make difficult decisions to balance the demands of responding directly to the COVID-19 pandemic, while simultaneously maintaining essential MNCAAH services. To support countries in adapting their response to different COVID-19 scenarios, WHO\u2019s Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing (MCA) Department is working closely in collaboration with other WHO departments to engage with countries in developing their optimal response to COVID-19 and reduce the indirect effects on pregnant women\/mothers, newborns, children, adolescents and older people (MNCAAH) due to health service disruption.<\/div><br\/><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objective<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">To conduct a rapid scoping review of measures taken to maintain the provision and the use of essential services (facility, community, etc.) for MNCAAH, outcomes (where documented) and lessons learned during past outbreaks including Ebola, SARS and Zika, including anything already available for COVID-19. As initial scoping has shown a limited amount of literature on interventions undertaken, we may also expand the scope to include other large humanitarian events that caused service, transport and other disruptions including such the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the 2011 Tohuku earthquake and tsunami and the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Our review was guided by the standard principles of Arksey & O\u2019Malley\u2019s framework. Arksey & O\u2019Malley\u2019s approach can be described as an iterative process involving post-hoc inclusion and exclusion criteria. According to this framework there are five stages: 1) identifying the research question, 2) identifying relevant studies, 3) study selection, 4) charting the data, and lastly 5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Definitions<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Target populations<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>- <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Maternal health <\/span><span>refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period.
