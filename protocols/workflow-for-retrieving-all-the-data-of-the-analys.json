Also, considering the average number of articles published by the selected journal as the determinant of the sample sizing might put some journals (especially the less representative ones) in a disadvantage position, since the number of articles published by some journals is much fewer than the monthly average of published articles in the period covered by the research.

In these cases, it is common that articles are plenty of mentions and quotations. However, considering the purposes and the general length of an article, it is not recommended to have too extended bibliographic references lists. First, because having plenty of quotations and mentions in a text might make its reading tiring and boring, in addition to obfuscating the author's own arguments. Second, because the discussion presented in an article should be not too short as not to include the exposition of purposes, methods, results, and the author's arguments, nor too long in order to be out of character and confused with other types of publications. Since there is no convention regarding the range of the length of bibliographic references lists (and in fact, there are no means for it, without impairing the specificity of each work that may require longer and in-depth discussions), authors are expected to use common sense when writing their scientific productions. On the other hand, some publishers use templates for diagraming articles and, in these cases, there might be some specific area for bibliographic references lists, which no possibilities of length adjustments and so, the author have to write their texts in order to fit in that specific space delimited by the publisher.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":932460,"guid":"B74EBCB08E2B11EA843CB5184CC41B50","previous_id":932459,"previous_guid":"A982A1F08E2B11EA843CB5184CC41B50","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"DD3336DD66824C989CDB603769B0CA6C","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"The journal analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"BA19D632B5284CCE86514CA9F0298DF1","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">The way instructions for publishing are transmitted to authors: this topic is not about the instructions for publishing properly. This is regarding the way instructions for presenting and formatting mentions, quotations, and bibliographic references (the reference style itself) is presented to the authors. Some publishers indicate a specific reference style to be used in their publications, which can be widely accepted ones, i.e. Vancouver and Chicago or even self-authored reference styles. Others give few examples on how to present and format citation metadata, extracted from widely accepted reference styles, to support authors' decisions regarding presenting and formatting bibliographic metadata. usually, in these cases, there is any orientation regarding the way of presenting mentions or quotations, whether between single or double quotation marks, when indents should be applied, etc. Other publishers accept submissions formatted according to any reference style and make available a team that is responsible for the formatting of citation data for accepted works according to the journal's style (not always free of charge for the author). The approach referring to this item should consider the way these formatting instructions are provided to the authors by publishers and then evaluate the level of clarity of these guidelines, classifying them into clear or unclear. For instance,  instructions providing an explicitly clear and comprehensive set of instructions for managing citation data, or indicating a specific external widely accepted reference style, i.e. Vancouver reference style, should be classified as clear.

As being a literal reproduction of a cited work, the quoted passage should be evidenced within the citing work's text, i.e. marked up between quotation marks or in an indented paragraph. Most (if not all) of the reference styles recommend the adoption of quotation marks (double or single) as a mark up for quotations which should be followed by an in-text reference pointer. For articles adopting the author-date citing system, the in-text reference pointer should provide at a minimum the cited author surname, the year of publication of the cited work and the initial and final page numbers where the excerpt quoted may be found within the cited work. For articles adopting the citation-sequence system, the in-text reference pointers concerning quotations generally provide a number corresponding to the respective bibliographic reference it refers to in the bibliographic references list, followed by the initial and final pages from where the quoted excerpt was extracted in the cited work. These metadata format presentations are usually mandatory within reference styles' guidelines and configure quite crucial metadata for retrieving the quoted content in the cited works.

Considering that there is no established standard on the length that defines long quotations, which are generally presented with an indent, and short quotations, which are generally presented between quotation marks, it is expected to confirm that there is no uniformity on the way quotations are presented within journals, regarding the use of quotation marks and also indent formatting.

Once the pages numbers where the quoted passages can be found in the cited work are usually given within in-text reference pointers, it is attributed a FRBRized feature to them. That means that by giving the page numbers, the in-text reference pointer usually refers to a FRBR manifestation, while the omission of this metadata generally links the in-text reference pointer to a FRBR Manifestation. Since the cited content stands out in relation to the support in which it was published, it does not matter whether the citing author consulted the electronic or the printed version of a work. What really matters in this respect is that the work remains the same, regardless of the embodiment it may take. Considering that approach, this point of the analysis should identify the relationship established between quotations, its respective in-text reference pointers, and the respective bibliographic references. The initial premises suggests that bibliographic references generally describe the cited works considering the  FRBR manifestation level, while in-text reference pointers, not always share the same FRBRized perspective. Facing this, the number of in-text reference pointers referring to quotations corresponding to the FRBR Works, FRBR expressions, and FRBR manifestations concepts should be quantified. In a complementary way, bibliographic references should be considered under the same perspective. then, the results of both observations should be put together to determine the rate of distinction between the level of description observed within in-text reference pointers referring to quotations and their respective bibliographic references, from the FRBR perspective.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA94FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":932486,"guid":"4D34DB008E3211EA843CB5184CC41B50","previous_id":932485,"previous_guid":"329ED3408E3211EA843CB5184CC41B50","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6C3AD62138844FE79E69F08FC57D63BC","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"The article analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D6F4A480653F45F7B28CCBF6C2B71F89","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">The total number of bibliographic references: Theoretically, the total number of bibliographic references observed in the bibliographic references list should be equal to the number of works cited within the text it belongs to. starting from this premise, the analysis should quantify the total of bibliographic references per article. <\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA94FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":932487,"guid":"619D9E108E3211EA843CB5184CC41B50","previous_id":1014048,"previous_guid":"E7186BF0E7AC11EA82E3E7FD48ADE2D1","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"4D9E82B9C5C24B2096492CE43C3A14B5","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"The article analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"B22C0D32988A45A4B0ACDEE963598D96","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">The use of et al.: et al. is the Latin abbreviature of et alii, and is used in bibliographic references and in in-text reference pointers to omit the name of multiple authors, usually when they are more than 3, according to the reference style adopted.

It should be quantified the following aspects: <\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">a) the number of bibliographic references not including hypertext links or DOI metadata, considering only bibliographic references referring to freely available online works, <\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">b) the total number of bibliographic references including hypertext links, considering the whole bibliographic references.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA94FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":932492,"guid":"D7D830408E3211EA843CB5184CC41B50","previous_id":932491,"previous_guid":"B7109E108E3211EA843CB5184CC41B50","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7DEAB907E20646DA835FC6BD30CB976A","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"The article analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"B5D0BC56270D4766BE67564A69F12B6F","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">The link rot issues: Electronic resources available on the Internet are subject to be reallocated or made unavailable permanently.
