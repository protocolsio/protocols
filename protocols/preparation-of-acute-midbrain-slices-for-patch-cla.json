Very carefully lift each half of the skull and check if the dura mater is still stuck to the brain or it instead lifts with the bone. If the dura is still there, make sure you carefully detach it by inserting the tip of the forceps right below it and moving the tip across the bone (from front to back). Do the same for both sides and make sure the meninges are out of the picture before proceeding. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF. This is a critical step, if not done the remaining meninges can cut the entire brain when you lift the skull in the next step.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, switch to the thick serrated forceps.

Then carefully separate the useful part of the brain from the skull and gently transfer (do NOT drop) to the 400 mL beaker with the remaining slush of slicing ACSF (which has been bubbling on ice until now).
