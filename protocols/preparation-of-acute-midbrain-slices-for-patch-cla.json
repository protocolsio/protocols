Carefully cut the diaphragm and cut around the rib cage until you see the heart. Carefully cut the right atrium - blood should start coming out. Quickly leave the scissors and get the syringe with the ice-cold slicing ACSF (squirt a bit of solution to ensure there are no bubbles in the tip).

This is where you will keep immersing the head while doing the brain extraction, in order to keep it as cold as possible. Having a separate beaker for the extraction and decapitation also reduces the amount of blood carried over.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Take the head from the small beaker and place in the crystallizing dish with clean slush.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Hold the head to ensure the skull is stable by applying pressure to the snout (adopt a sort of pinching position with the thumb and index that surrounds the snout and with the maximal pressure on the phalanges - never apply pressure to the skull itself, as you will compress and damage the brain). Have your middle finger beneath it as a support. Importantly, you should ensure you practice this in advance, having a good and stable grip will be critical to extract the brain as quickly and safely as possible.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Use the medium size scissors to cut through the skin along the midline and expose the skull. Start at the back of the neck and make your way until the snout. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, switch to the tiny serrated scissors. Start to very carefully cut through the bone from the foramen magnum in the following sequence.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">(1) The first two cuts will be to the sides, from the foramen magnum around the temporal bone until the zygomatic bone or the ear canal (surrounding the cerebellum). This two cuts (one to the right and one to the left) are very important as will reach the insertion of most meninges: making sure these are cut will prevent they slash through the brain and separate the cerebellum and inferior colliculus from the superior colliculus and periaqueductal gray.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">(2) Next, once again insert the tiny serrated scissors in the foramen magnum and proceed to cut the skull along the midline suture from caudal to rostral until you reach the snout. Make sure you cut \"up\" when you advance with the scissors (never \"down\" towards the brain) to avoid pressing the bone on the tissue. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">(3) Finally, make two tiny cuts from the midline to the laterals at the level of the olfactory bulb. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">N.B<\/span><span>: although you must be fast, it is also critical to be very careful and to keep mechanical stress to the minimum - the midbrain is incredibly sensitive. In addition, as already mentioned above, always make the scissor cuts in the upper direction, so that instead of applying pressure to the skull you are lifting it away from the brain. In many cases, insufficient slice quality is due to problems at this very early stage.<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, switch to the fine Dumont forceps. Very carefully lift each half of the skull and check if the dura mater is still stuck to the brain or it instead lifts with the bone. If the dura is still there, make sure you carefully detach it by inserting the tip of the forceps right below it and moving the tip across the bone (from front to back). Do the same for both sides and make sure the meninges are out of the picture before proceeding. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF. This is a critical step, if not done the remaining meninges can cut the entire brain when you lift the skull in the next step.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, switch to the thick serrated forceps. Remove the skull by lifting the cut bone with the forceps while moving the hand that holds the head in the opposite direction. Do the same for the other side. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, take the blade. Make sure you are holding the head as flat as possible. Make one cut at the level of the cerebellum and one in the front to remove a good chunk of the frontal lobe. It is very important this second cut is as straight as possible as this is the surface the brain will stand on when we glue it.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, grab the spatula and carefully scoop the cut parts out. Then carefully separate the useful part of the brain from the skull and gently transfer (do NOT drop) to the 400 mL beaker with the remaining slush of slicing ACSF (which has been bubbling on ice until now). Use the perforated spoon to carefully scoop a pocket in the slush so that the brain falls and remains completely submerged in it. Make sure the bubbling is not too close to the brain.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Now the hardest bit is done and you can breath. This should have taken less than a minute. You can leave the brain to recover for a minute or so in the cold solution, this will ensure to slow down the metabolism and reduce excitotoxicity.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">In the meantime, bring the now empty skull back to the hood and put in the plastic bag together with the carcass. Properly dispose of the carcass. Turn off the oxygen from the wall and watch the rubber that indicates the flow rate fall to zero. Make sure the isoflurane is off. Then close the circuit from the anaesthetic chamber and switch off the scavenging system. Clean the area with ddH2O from any blood or ACSF and wipe with 70% ethanol. Switch the hood ventilation off. Bring the beaker and scissors to the sink. We will finish cleaning up later.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Get the slicing chamber from the freezer. Make sure the magnetized block is dry and the glue hasn't hardened.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Use the perforated spoon to carefully lift the brain out of the beaker. Take extra care not to push it against the glass wall. Gently place on the filter paper in the petri dish. Add enough slush ACSF to cover it. Use the brush to carefully remove any slush that has stuck to the brain, so that it is free. Re-position the brain so that it sits on the cut you made in the frontal part of the brain (i.e. the cerebellum is facing up to you).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Put glue on the magnetized block. Make sure there is enough to glue the brain, but not so much the brain swims on it.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span>With the spatula on your dominant hand and the brush on the other one, carefully load the brain on the spatula so that the frontal side faces down (i.e. the bit where the olfactory bulb would have been is in contact with the spatula, and the cerebellum is facing up towards you). Next, carefully lift the brain and gently touch a clean tissue paper to dry out any excess liquid (this will ensure the tissue sticks to the glue). Place the brain on the glue and use the brush to gently press the cortex down to ensure it properly sticks to the magnetized block (only do that if you don't care about the cortex). <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">N.B<\/span><span>: be very gentle when rotating the brain and moving it to the block. Do not hit the magnetized block against the table and avoid any unnecessary mechanical stress to the tissue.<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Rapidly use the glass pipette to pour some ice-cold slicing ACSF from the petri dish over the brain - this will both keep the brain cold and harden the glue.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Carefully mount the magnetized block on the slicing chamber and proceed to fill the chamber with ice-cold slicing ACSF.
