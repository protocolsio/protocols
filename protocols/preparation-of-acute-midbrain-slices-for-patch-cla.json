In many cases, insufficient slice quality is due to problems at this very early stage.<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, switch to the fine Dumont forceps. Very carefully lift each half of the skull and check if the dura mater is still stuck to the brain or it instead lifts with the bone. If the dura is still there, make sure you carefully detach it by inserting the tip of the forceps right below it and moving the tip across the bone (from front to back). Do the same for both sides and make sure the meninges are out of the picture before proceeding. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF. This is a critical step, if not done the remaining meninges can cut the entire brain when you lift the skull in the next step.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, switch to the thick serrated forceps. Remove the skull by lifting the cut bone with the forceps while moving the hand that holds the head in the opposite direction. Do the same for the other side. Fully immerse the head in the ice-cold slush slicing ACSF.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, take the blade. Make sure you are holding the head as flat as possible. Make one cut at the level of the cerebellum and one in the front to remove a good chunk of the frontal lobe. It is very important that this second cut is as straight as possible as this is the surface the brain will stand on when we glue it.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">With the brain still immersed in the slush, grab the spatula and carefully scoop the cut parts out. Then carefully separate the useful part of the brain from the skull and gently transfer (do NOT drop) to the 400 mL beaker with the remaining slush of slicing ACSF (which has been bubbling on ice until now). Use the perforated spoon to carefully scoop a pocket in the slush so that the brain falls and remains completely submerged in it.
