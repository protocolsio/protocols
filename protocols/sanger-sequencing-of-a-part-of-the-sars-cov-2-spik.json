This may require more than 45 cycles. Remember that Ct occurs many cycles before the maximum product amount is achieved in the PCR reaction, and that the 1kb product of this RT-PCR  amplifies less efficiently than a shorter fragment would, so a sample with Ct35 might require 45 cycles or more before the reaction run to the end.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Optional, but highly recommended: after the RT-PCR, measure the DNA concentration of one of the NTC and one of the positive controls as well as 5-10 samples on a fluorometric system (e.g. Qubit) or run an AGE gel of 1.5\u00b5L PCR product to confirm amplification. Nanodrop is strongly discouraged for DNA concentration measurements. The concentration of the RT-PCR product should be above 50 ng\/\u00b5L for reactions, which have run to completion.
