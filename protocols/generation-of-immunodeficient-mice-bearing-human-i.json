At weeks 15 and 18 the levels of T cells were significantly higher in newborn NSG mice as compared to 21-day old NSG mice. These data suggest that both newborn and 21-day old NSG mice support human T cells development, but the kinetics are accelerated in mice injected as newborns (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">See NOTE 5<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">)<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dvap4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"A46253D386D5421DABDAF3FEF16F9398","order_id":2,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">NOTE 5<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Immunodeficient mice expressing HLA class I and II have been used support HLA-rerstricted human T cell development and are commercially available (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3807974\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">27<\/span><\/a><span>).<\/span><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","note":null,"link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"D1234B84A51546F6BDC3B6754BBCA872","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dvap4kcn.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1189312,"guid":"41D70E60C31311EB93BF6F9FF2A62E03","previous_id":1189308,"previous_guid":"E58E2310C31111EB93BF6F9FF2A62E03","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"B1407E01F78A4C28AE61EEDE975C819B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"44CA90217B9E41D9BC13BCE6DD982F20","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">B cell development.

These \u201chumanized\u201d mice are being used to study human hematopoiesis, human-specific immune therapies, human-specific pathogens, and human immune system homeostasis and function. The establishment of these model systems is technically challenging, and levels of human immune system development reported in the literature are variable between laboratories. The use of standard protocols for optimal engraftment of HSC and for monitoring the development of the human immune systems would enable more direct comparisons between humanized mice generated in different laboratories.
