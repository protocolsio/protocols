Then carefully dump off the water and replace with 50-70 mL of colloidal coomassie blue staining solution (the product of step 4).  You want just enough to fully cover the gel.  Microwave the gel + stain solution again for 30-45 seconds or until very warm.  Let the gel rock on a rocking platform for 3-10 minutes while checking occassionally how the bands are developing.  Once fully stained (takes usually no longer than 15 min) you can dump off the staining solution and replace with 100-150 mL of water.  Microwave the gel in water for 45 seconds to heat it, and rock on a rocking platform with a tiny crumpled piece of kim wipe or paper napkin to accelerate destaining process.  You can change out the water and keep replacing the kimwipe until the destaining is complete enough.  Or just leave it out on your bench overnight in water.. the will destain nicely. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">I learned this Colloidal Coomassie Blue staining recipe and protocol when I was a postdoc at Harvard Medical School.. Rumor has it, a postdoc reverse engineered a \u201csafe stain\u201d from a leading commercial supplier. It\u2019s a really great recipe: much more sensitive, faster, and easier to use than traditional methanol based coomassie staining protocols you see in Cold Spring Harbor books, like by Maniatis etc..  Saves a ton of money compared to buying this stuff from commercial vendors.  It is downstream compatible with mass spec and most other things you'd want to do with gel slices. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1600797405}
