To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use pH sensing technology in the respiratory tract of infected and non-infected mice. In addition, individual cell properties differ significantly in size, protein levels, and expression. Therefore, we performed single intracellular pH analyses to better understand the cellular responses in different respiratory tissues and complex environments in response to IAVs, especially pandemic viruses. We report potentials in local extracellular pH in different parts of the mouse respiratory tract in correlation to the intracellular measurement of a single cell the local immune response.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1621274818}
