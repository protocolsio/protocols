class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The seqFISH Hyb Station is a custom built platform consists of\u00a0a liquid handling pump , a fluidic switcher , and a 96-well plate auto-sampler which aids seqFISH experiments by flowing hybridization reagents and washes in and out of a flow cell containing the biological sample. Researchers set up multi-day experiments to perform chemistries such as hybridizations, washes, and stripping. In each round of hybridization, the auto sampler handle will move to the designated well and approximately 100uL of readouts reagents are flowed into the custom made flow cell to allow hybridization. Following by imaging with a fluorescent microscope, the signals are extinguished by flowing in excess high formamide solution to melt away the readout probes. These steps are repeated until all hybridization rounds are completed. The controls of seqFISH Hyb Station and imaging are controlled and integrated using the open source software Micro-Manager.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1591987922}
