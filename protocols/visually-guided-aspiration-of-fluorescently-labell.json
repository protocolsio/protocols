With this visually guided aspiration approach, sample collection is quite slow. On a typical experiment, you can proceed to manually aspirate cells for up to 5-7 hours from the moment the slices are ready, and a total of 24 cells are usually collected. Take care to isolate cells in equal proportions from each hemisphere and brain area subdivision, following a sequence pseudo-randomised for each animal. A negative control containing only the 4 \u03bcL of lysis buffer should also be included for each batch of 24 cells to assess DNA contamination during the processing steps. To assess the amount of ambient mRNA added by the isolation method, negative controls can be obtained by inserting the glass pipette in the slice tissue without aspirating any cell. In some instances, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings can be obtained from the target neuron prior to aspiration.<\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":"","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","note":null,"link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":21600,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1153845,"guid":"2A1718C0923911EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","previous_id":1158958,"previous_guid":"2E614110988511EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"405FC059B3E6469699F659C66894EC31","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Smart-seq2 | cDNA preamplification"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"1302E260E0C84D39B0AD52466B749752","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">[PCR preamplification]<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">For each sample, you will need 25 \u03bcL of PCR mix:<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">10 \u03bcL product of the reverse transcription reaction (previous section).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">12.5 \u03bcL KAPA HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (2x, KAPA Biosystems).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">0.25 \u03bcL ISPCR primer (10 \u03bcM).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">2.25 \u03bcL nuclease-free water.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84cd83","section_duration":10800,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1153846,"guid":"34103280923911EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","previous_id":1158763,"previous_guid":"C9F04F20985A11EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"1B8A2212D1A849EEBA8C7462E6AA37F1","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Smart-seq2 | cDNA purification and quality control"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"141E1419F3C942AE8BE2B0D543F93F98","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">[Purification ~3h]<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">This step can be done without the hood.

Furthermore, sequencing facilities tend to be a bit conservative on the total amount of cDNA they input on a given sequencing run to avoid saturating the system, which usually means that you will never use up 100% of the available reads in the kit you choose. Overall, this means that only a fraction of the reads you think you will get are used, and only a fraction of the reads used will give you useful data.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">We observed a similar trend in our experiments. We used the Illumina NextSeq 500 High-output sequencing kit, which provides up to 400 million reads that are spread between the 96 samples we sequence together. This approach should theoretically result in a sequencing depth of ~4.16 million reads per sample. However, the average number of reads uniquely mapping to annotated exons was ~2.2 million reads per sample (~53% of the target), out of which ~13% corresponded to Mitochondrial genes, Ribosomal genes, ERCC spike-ins, or TSO concatamers. The rest was probably lost in multimapping reads, reads with no match on the genome, and reads not used due to inputting an amount of cDNA below the actual limit of the kit and sequencing system. Overall, we achieved ~1.9 million uniquely mapping reads per sample, a value that according to most studies is beyond the saturation point of gene detection for accuracy and sensitivity.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#4a90e2","section_duration":2419200,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1158824,"guid":"B887E6E0987211EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","previous_id":1158013,"previous_guid":"89A4D0C097CA11EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"5B2B02C2568C448490ADEEB2F40BCC61","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Preparation of tools, instruments, and solutions for the day"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"558E907C2BA24C6D9A75DD4D31F9E198","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Finding the right program will take several rounds of testing.

Having a good experimental design will ensure you can use the data to address the biological questions you have in mind, while circumventing the problems arising from batch effects. <\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">The processing of different batches of samples is often subject to uncontrollable differences, e.g., changes in operator, differences in reagent quality, etc. This results in systematic differences in the observed gene expression in cells from different batches, which are often referred to as \u201cbatch effects\u201d. Batch effects are problematic as they can be major drivers of heterogeneity in the data, masking the relevant biological differences and complicating interpretation of the results.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">The approach followed in this protocol means that all the cells collected on a given experimental day will come from the same animal. Thus, if collecting (1) different cell-types or (2) one cell-type from different brain areas or different subdivisions from the same area in the same animal, it is critical to equally sample each variable in a pseudo-randomised order. If using transgenic animals and thus collecting different cell-types on different days (e.g. collecting cell-type A from animal 1, and cell-type B from animal 2), it is critical to account for that when processing the samples. <\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Ideally, if you are able to process 20 samples at once (what would be one processing batch), you should make sure that the sample distribution equally covers different cell-types, animals, and experimental days. Furthermore, each animal could be treated as a separate batch in their own right, reflecting (presumably uninteresting) biological differences due to genotype, age, sex, or other factors that are inherent to the experimental design. What you want to avoid is that one processing batch contains only 20 samples from the same cell-type and animal, as this would mean that these three variables (batch, cell-type, animal) are confounded and you won't be able to know which one is driving the biological effects on your data. Finally, it is a good idea to always add positive controls (e.g. ERCC spike-ins) and negative controls (empty samples or pipette tips that went into the slice but did not contain a cell) in each processing batch.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#417505","section_duration":10800,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1158941,"guid":"6C76E100988311EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","previous_id":1158863,"previous_guid":"991E7990987C11EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7FA168218BAF4F6FAE23C4BCEB8FAE8E","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Smart-seq2 | cDNA synthesis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"65A9917E40254D5089104F06E241D236","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Take the samples from the -80\u00b0C freezer and incubate at 72\u00b0C for 3 minutes in the thermal cycler.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Immediately put the tubes back on ice (keeping samples on ice reduces secondary structure formation).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Spin down the samples (700g for 10 seconds at room temperature) to collect the liquid at the bottom of the tubes, and immediately put them back on ice.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">The oligo-dT primers are now hybridized to the poly(A) tail of the mRNA molecules.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#417505","section_duration":10800,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1158958,"guid":"2E614110988511EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","previous_id":1158972,"previous_guid":"AD587FF0988611EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"8CB85726C7B541FB99A4DD4FBAF19920","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Smart-seq2 | cDNA synthesis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"DF0240F69A3240DCAACBBDDA8A5A84FD","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">To obtain cDNA from the single-cell lysates, the mRNA of each sample needs to be reverse transcribed by subjecting the samples to the following program in the thermal cycler:<\/div><br\/><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/d62ubd72f.jpg\" \/><\/div><br\/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"E6BB10A0224E4B78B0F6A65C1D5164B0","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/d62ubd72f.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#417505","section_duration":10800,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1158972,"guid":"AD587FF0988611EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","previous_id":1158941,"previous_guid":"6C76E100988311EB89F3D7B3B93F1343","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"64A88D8BE44E4F4CB7AACC17867BEEA0","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Smart-seq2 | cDNA synthesis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"C7A71ABD734A465BBFC0C93EC1A5A9D3","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">With the samples on ice, carefully add the RT mix.

Here we describe a protocol to perform visually guided aspiration of fluorescently labelled single neurons from acute midbrain slices of transgenic mice, followed by Smart-seq2 and deep sequencing. This protocol enables researchers to obtain detailed transcriptomic profiles from any cell-type labelled using transgenic lines - and potentially other methods like viral injections - located in a brain area of interest.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1628695146}
