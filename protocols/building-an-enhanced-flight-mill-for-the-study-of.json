The flight mill was set up within an incubator set to 28 \u00b0C\/27 \u00b0C (day\/night), 70% relative humidity, and a 14 h light\/10 h dark cycle. For each trial, the flight track of multiple bugs was recorded every hundredth of a second by the WinDAQ software for up to 24 h. After preliminary trials, flight behavior was categorized into bursting flight and continuous flight. Bursters flew sporadically for less than 10 min at a time, and continuous flyers flew uninterrupted for 10 min or longer. Any individual that did not exhibit continuous flight behavior within its 30 min testing phase was pulled off the flight mill and replaced with a new bug and its accompanying ID in an event marker comment. All bugs that exhibited continuous flight remained on the flight mill beyond 30 min until they stopped flying. Bugs were swapped from 8 AM to 4 PM each day. As represented in <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 9<\/span><span>, flight trials of individuals in a day's recording varied in length from 30 min to 11+ h. By inserting event markers at the addition of new individuals, this complex data structure becomes successfully processed through the Python scripts, and the code effectively helps users visualize the scope of their experiments. The proposed experimental setup captures the full flight capacity of insects; however, it omits the possibly of observing flight periodicity. Users then have the option to tailor their flight trials for different flight metrics and choose which flight behavior or strategies they most wish to test.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The on-screen waveform and diagnostic heatmap(s) also make it possible to identify gaps or resolve inconsistencies in the flight track data. <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 6A <\/span><span>shows a set of trials whose flight data were successfully recorded for all channels without noise or disruption.

This was possibly due to the crossing over of open wires or the loosening of wires. There are also particular events during recording that could occur but are corrected for in the Python scripts. This includes double troughs, mirror troughs, and voltage noise (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 6C,D<\/span><span>). These events lead to false trough readings, but they can reliably be identified and removed during analyses. <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 7 <\/span><span>compares three data files to show how noise or sensitive troughs in the recording data were diagnosed during the standardization process. The first (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 7A<\/span><span>) is a file whose troughs generated by each revolution of the flight mill arm were robust, meaning they largely deviated from the file's mean voltage. In turn, as the standardization interval around the mean increased, there was no change in the number of troughs identified. This suggested that there was no voltage noise, and the user can then be confident in the accuracy of the standardization. On the other hand, the third file (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 7C<\/span><span>) had troughs that were either too sensitive or had extraneous voltage noise that did not deviate largely from the file's mean voltage. As a result, its number of troughs decreased substantially as the standardization interval around the mean increased. It would then be advisable to look back into the original WDH recording file to confirm whether the insect was truly flying.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>By plotting the flight speed and duration statistics of the individual, flight behavior can be further characterized into four flight categories: bursts (B), bursts to continuous (BC), continuous to bursts (CB), and continuous (C), as represented in <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 8<\/span><span>. An individual that strictly exhibited continuous flight flew uninterrupted for 10 min or more at least by the end of its 30 min testing phase (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 8A<\/span><span>). An individual that flew sporadically throughout its 30 min testing phase exhibited bursting flight (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 8B<\/span><span>). An individual that initially exhibited continuous flight for more than 10 min and then tapered within its 30 min testing phase into sporadic bursts exhibited continuous to bursting flight (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 8C<\/span><span>). Finally, an individual that initially demonstrated bursting flight and then transitioned into continuous flight for the remainder of the 30 min testing phase and beyond exhibited bursting to continuous flight (<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Figure 8D<\/span><span>). Thus, specific to the model insect and experimental framework, the user can use this graphic output to assess and identify general flight behavior patterns despite unique variations in individual tracks.<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/c7zgbgs67.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/c7zkbgs67.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/c7zqbgs67.jpg\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"CD4117DE279942C8BDCD6B85FEEC50F6","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/c7zgbgs67.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"690D2F781CD24939B3B35E8E92AA1F08","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/c7zkbgs67.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054727,"guid":"1A63C78D7DD7435C81F1652C839F3DD4","order_id":4,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/c7zqbgs67.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1146655,"guid":"BBC876EC3EEC4083A193DF7F84171F91","previous_id":1146654,"previous_guid":"E40112F31C224DC3BF5E212115D655F4","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"9E46BD0F11DF4540A846E25F615E7EAE","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"B0834ADF759B4C3787FAE71185B44FF4","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Discussion<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The simple, modern flight mill provides a range of advantages for researchers interested in studying tethered insect flight by delivering a reliable and automated design that tests multiple insects efficiently and cost-effectively<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">13, 31, 35<\/span><span>. Likewise, there is a strong incentive for researchers to adopt fast-emerging technologies and techniques from industry and other scientific fields as a means to build experimental tools to study ecological systems<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">9, 32, 33<\/span><span>. This protocol takes advantage of two rapidly emerging technologies, the 3D printer and the laser cutter, which are becoming increasingly available in communal makerspaces, in order to enhance the simple, modern flight mill. These enhancements provide a more flexible, adjustable, and collapsible design that accommodates insects of different sizes, minimizes stress placed on the insect, and allows the flight mill to be transported easily to multiple locations or environments. Furthermore, the additional expenses of using the technologies are minimal or even free. However, these technologies can also be a challenge to experiment with if reaching proficiency in using vector graphics editors and 3D image software is not readily available. In turn, the flight mill presented here serves to both encourage researchers to incorporate available emerging technologies in their workflow and to allow researchers to build a customizable, flexible, and effective flight mill without specialized knowledge of electronics, programming, or CAD models.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The strongest aspects of this protocol are the makerspace's technologies that expand a user's flight mill design options, the use of magnetic paint to minimize insect stress, and the automation of flight recordings that processes multiple insects within a single recording. The laser cutter offers precise and exact cutting capabilities that can handle jobs of almost any complexity. The user can modify the acrylic support structure to mount additional 3D prints or purchased items. The 3D printer allows the user to create customizable flight mill components that can bypass costly, pre-made products with narrowly adjustable dimensions. 3D prints not proposed in this paper can also be built, such as landing platforms, supports that can quickly exchange between magnetic bearings and ball bearings, or even a new attachment that tethers an insect. Finally, the use of automated recording software and Python scripts to differentiate multiple flight trials within a single recording makes it possible to study sporadic bouts of flight to very long bouts of flight. However, given how variable flight activity and duration is across species, it is suggested that the user conducts preliminary trials in order to understand the limits and general patterns of a species' flight behavior so as to optimize data collection. The user can also assess the integrity of their recordings using the diagnostic heatmap(s) and can account for any necessary speed corrections in the scripts.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Researchers should also be aware of the flight mill's general constraints.

Additionally, there continue to be inconsistencies on how to categorize or more precisely quantify the short or 'trivial' bursts insects display, especially when comparing the flight behavior and mechanisms of large migratory insects to those of small insects who exhibit mostly hovering flight<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">24, 36, 37<\/span><span>. Despite these limitations, there has been significant progress in capturing and categorizing flight behavior within insect species, and researchers have continued to couple the flight mill with other technologies and methods<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">6, 7, 8<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The makerspace as a location of creativity, collaboration, and low barriers will further inspire researchers to troubleshoot 3D print design limitations or laser cut more intricate designs.

In turn, researchers with little design knowledge will be able to deepen it, and researchers who are also educators can take advantage of this space as a means to increase design organization, craftmanship, and<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">technical dexterity for students. In a discipline like ecology that already makes use of a variety of tools for field and laboratory work, researchers can also develop, share, and standardize novel or enhanced tools. The flight mill proposed in this paper is only the start of what could be an approach to democratizing and rapidly spreading new means of collecting data.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Flight mills have played an important role in enabling researchers to understand the dispersal of insects - an ecological phenomenon still essentially intractable in the field. Future advances in the design and application of the flight mill can be achieved as researchers become more proficient in emerging technologies and the software accompanying those technologies. This could include designing flight mill arm bearings that allow vertical lift or give the insect greater flight orientation flexibility. Additionally, the precision of laser cutters and 3D printers may be necessary for researchers interested in scaling down and calibrating for small insects with mostly hovering capabilities. In turn, the goal of this protocol was to provide an easy entry to these technologies while constructing one of the most common and useful devices in the field of behavioral ecology - the flight mill.

This protocol demonstrates how to take advantage of the technology found in makerspaces in order to build a more versatile flight mill for a relatively low cost. Given that this study extracted its prototype from flight mills built in the last decade, this protocol focuses more on outlining divergences made from the simple, modern flight mill. Previous studies have already shown how advantageous flight mills are to measuring flight parameters such as speed, distance, or periodicity. Such mills have allowed researchers to associate these parameters with morphological, physiological, or genetic factors. In addition to these advantages, this study discusses the benefits of using the technology in makerspaces, like 3D printers and laser cutters, in order to build a more flexible, sturdy, and collapsible flight mill design. Most notably, the 3D printed components of this design allow the user to test insects of various sizes by making the heights of the mill arm and infrared (IR) sensors adjustable. The 3D prints also enable the user to easily disassemble the machine for quick storage or transportation to the field. Moreover, this study makes greater use of magnets and magnetic paint to tether insects with minimal stress. Lastly, this protocol details a versatile analysis of flight data through computer scripts that efficiently separate and analyze differentiable flight trials within a single recording. Although more labor-intensive, applying the tools available in makerspaces and on online 3D modeling programs facilitates multidisciplinary and process-orientated practices and helps researchers avoid costly, premade products with narrowly adjustable dimensions. By taking advantage of the flexibility and reproducibility of technology in makerspaces, this protocol promotes creative flight mill design and inspires open science.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1616000558}
