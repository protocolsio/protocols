The outcomes of interest will be: preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, cesarean delivery rate, preterm birth (<37 weeks), low birthweight (<2.5 kg) and fetal death.

Random-effects models will be fitted using the Paule-Mandel method for between-study variance estimation. Pool estimates of odds ratios will be calculated. The inter-study heterogeneity will be quantified by the inconsistency index (I2), while the 95% predictive intervals will be calculated to assess the effects to be expected by future studies. Subgroup analysis is planned based on whether appropriate participant matching was applied or not. Funnel plots will be constructed and the Egger\u2019s test will be performed to assess their asymmetry, if appropriate (>10 studies).<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Quality of evidence\n The quality of the existing evidence will be appraised following the GRADE approach. Specifically, evidence will be classified as very low, low, moderate or high by judging the following domains: study limitations, consistency, directness, imprecision and publication bias.<\/li><\/ol><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Living kidney donation is growing, especially among young women.
