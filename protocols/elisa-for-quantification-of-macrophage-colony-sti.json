They play essential roles in the activation and differentiation of immune cells, as well as proliferation, maturation, migration, and adhesion. They also have pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties. The primary function of interleukins is, therefore, to modulate growth, differentiation, and activation during inflammatory and immune responses. Interleukins consist of a large group of proteins that can elicit many reactions in cells and tissues by binding to high-affinity receptors in cell surfaces.  <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/NBK499840\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">[1]<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The immunoregulatory cytokine IL-41 (also known as meteorin-like protein) is expressed at high levels in the synovium of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).[2]<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Reference<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>1.
