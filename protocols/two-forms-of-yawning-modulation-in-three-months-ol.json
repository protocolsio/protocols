One of the characteristic features of yawning is its timing, with a gradual acceleration followed by an abrupt deceleration of the facial actions involved. Yawning usually emerges from a relaxed face, initially involving mouth stretching widely open (AUs 25 + 27) and upper eyelids drooping (AU 43). Although the specific AUs accompanying yawns vary, at apex they may include tightly closed eyelids (AUs 6+7+43), flattened tongue shape (AU 76b), and swallowing (AU 80). During the plateau, brow knitting (AU 3), brow knotting (AU 4), nose wrinkling (AU 9), lateral lip stretching (AU 20), nostril dilatation (AU 38) and head tilting back (AU 53) may occur. In this phase, the expansion of the pharynx can quadruple its diameter, while the larynx opens up with maximal abduction of the vocal cords. Yawning is often accompanied by limb stretching and other bodily movements.\u201d<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1181593,"guid":"C5A95670B7F211EBA640EBE957AFD20A","previous_id":1181592,"previous_guid":"8FA07B80B7F211EBA640EBE957AFD20A","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"B773EAE21DE54BB29B8FFDD96EC86629","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"32E9385DA1F44B778A44E56AC94E9DA1","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Self-touch hand movements coding<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Self-touch hand movements should be identified based on the following description from SCPB.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>\u201cThese movements involve hands and arms and ends with the contact of hand or fingers with the head, face or mouth region.

Although most scholars have focused on its potential physiological functions, e.g., related to thermoregulation, arousal modulation or cortisol levels, an emerging line of research has been investigating the social implications of yawning, including its hypothesized relationship with empathy. This protocol is designed in order to test for potential gender differences in yawning and self-touch hand movements occurrences during the Face to Face Still Face (FFSF) procedure. Moreover, through the use of path analysis, the protocol allows to investigate potential dynamics of facilitation, inhibition or covariance, between and within the two behavioral patterns across the three episodes of the paradigm. Analogous protocols can be used to test analogous hypotheses with regard to other behavioral patterns.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1621505002}
