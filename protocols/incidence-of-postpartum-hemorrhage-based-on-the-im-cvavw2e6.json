Firstly, the volume of the blood collection basin used in vaginal delivery and the suction bottle used in cesarean section can be directly read (the volume of amniotic fluid and irrigating fluid need to be deducted). During vaginal delivery, when the amniotic fluid had basically flowed completely after fetal birth, then the blood collection basin was placed under the maternal buttocks to collect blood loss. The medical covering drape used in cesarean section is waterproof, which can collect amniotic fluid and blood loss effectively. During cesarean section, the assistant used a negative pressure aspirator to collect as much amniotic fluid as possible after the rupture of amniotic membrane and record the amount of amniotic fluid in the suction bottle. Then removed the amount of amniotic fluid when calculating the blood loss in the suction bottle. Secondly, the remaining bleeding on the operating table was calculated by the area method (10cm×10cm is referred as 10 mL). At last, the perineal pad was placed under maternal buttocks until 24 hours after delivery. The perineal pad would be replaced several times, and the final weight was calculated totally (blood volume (mL) = (the weight of the pad used - the weight before use)/1.05). The sum of the blood loss in the above three steps is the total blood loss within 24 hours after delivery.
