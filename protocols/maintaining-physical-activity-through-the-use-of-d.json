Previous research has identified a beneficial impact of PA on pain, function and overall health (2, 3, 4). However, levels of PA are often lower in people with a long-term condition (LTC) and decline further for those with multiple conditions (5, 6). Digital tools, such as websites, apps or wearables, show some potential for supporting engagement with PA in the short term (7, 8), but lack data on maintaining PA behaviours longer term. A search of existing reviews in this area identified only a small number of systematic reviews that included digital interventions with a focus on maintaining PA for people with a LTC (9, 10, 11). Of these, only Grimmett et al (2019) reported effective maintenance at >3 months post-intervention (9). Consequently, a scoping review methodology has been chosen to explore digital PA maintenance for people with a LTC more widely.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The aims of this review are to:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Identify the range and variety of digital tools and their associated theoretical foundations for supporting people with a LTC\/s to maintain physical activity.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Uncover the components considered to be necessary for engagement with digital tools to support maintenance of physical activity<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Review objectives:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What is the \u201cextent (size), range (variety) and nature (characteristics) of the evidence\u201d (12) on digital tools to support the maintenance of physical activity for people with a LTC\/s?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What theoretical underpinnings are used in digital tools to promote the maintenance of physical activity?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What are the experiences of people using digital tools to maintain physical activity?<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">What are the barriers and facilitators to maintaining physical activity for people with a LTC\/s using digital tools?<\/li><\/ol><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Design<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This scoping review will be undertaken in accordance with PRISMA-ScR guidelines (12) and the frameworks developed by Arksey and O\u2019Malley (13) and Levac et al., (14).
