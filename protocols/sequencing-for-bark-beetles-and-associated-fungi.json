If you are submitting 48 or less, please follow the GENEWIZ protocol below, using 8 strip cap tubes. If you have greater than 48 samples, please submit using a prepaid plate through Eurofins, following the Eurofins protocol below.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">You may prefer to use one company over the other for a multitude of reasons. For submitting larger numbers of samples to GENEWIZ, the protocol is roughly the same, but you use semi skirted plates and strip caps. For submitting fewer samples to Eurofins, we have barcodes (used for loose 1.5mL vials, which they use for orders of less than 24 samples)and packaging material available. Please follow the guidelines for sample submission on the Eurofins Genomics website.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">GENEWIZ<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In general, we will be using the \u201cCustom\u201d option for GENEWIZ. This entails sending 10uL of diluted un-purified PCR product per sample, with 5uL of 5uM primer per sample. For most cases, we will opt to have clean up performed at the facility.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Primers: Send 5uL of 5uM primer per sample to be sequenced. To make a solution of 5uM in 5uL, mix 2.5uL of your 10x primer stock with 2.5uL PCR water. Multiply these values by your number of samples + 2 and send in one Eppendorf tube per primer. Label with the primer name and concentration (5uM).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Template: Send in 10uL of your un-purified PCR product per well. This can be diluted with water, 0.5uL PCR product mixed with 0.5uL water tends to work well for most. If your band is strong and you know your concentration is high, you can increase the dilution to conserve PCR product. If it is weak or you know the concentration is low, you can send in less dilute product.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Submitting samples:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1) Create or log in to your GENEWIZ account. If this is your first time creating it, use 11575668 as the PI\/Institution ID. Contact Zach with your account email to be added to the Lab Group to share payment info and sequence results.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">2) Create a sequencing order from your account page. Choose the options for \u201cSame Day\u201d and \u201cUpload Excel Form.\u201d Choose and download the \u201cCustom Form.\u201d<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">3) Fill out and upload the Excel form by typing in your sample names, primer names, and Primer Concentrations. Select your DNA Type, DNA Length, and Special Protocols from their drop down menus. You can skip DNA Concentration, GENEWIZ Primer, and Notes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">4) Select payment method. You may use your own P-card if you have one. If not, access to our Lab Group should allow you to use Zach\u2019s.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">5) Select the Newins-Ziegler Hall Mailroom as your sample pickup location.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">6) Submit your request, here you can print off the form you will include with your samples. This will also give you vial labels if you are sending in samples in strip tubes, label these values on the sides. Plates do not need labels as the excel file assigns well positions. Use 8 strip domed caps to seal vials and plates. You can wrap in parafilm for extra security.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">7) Place samples in ziploc sample bag with primers and the provided order form. Drop off your sample in the GENEWIZ box in the NZH mail room before 4pm on the day of submission for pickup. If you cannot make it by this time, send an email to DNASeq@genewiz.com on the day you drop it off to notify them so it will be picked up.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Pricing: For custom orders the cost is $4 per sample. Clean up is an additional $1. You can perform clean up yourself, however this saves us little money given the cost of ExoSAP.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><h2><\/h2><\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of this protocol is to describe the submission for sequencing at the UF Forest Entomology Lab.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol is part of the Bark Beetle Mycobiome (BBM) Research Coordination Network.
