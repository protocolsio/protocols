MPT disapproves of most theories of psychotherapy, wherein psychoanalysts, exaggerating the past, place individuals in very deep holes and indoctrinate them with some disgusting lies, and in fact, instill truths in their own minds and suggest a difficult way to cope with them. The analytical method has been also exploited to reflect on the theory of MPT. The results of this study revealed that MPT, recruiting the concept of rich mind, opens a new path for clients to effortlessly remove many problems in order to reach perfection and nurture their soul.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"DISCLAIMER – FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe protocol content here is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal, medical, clinical, or safety advice, or otherwise; content added to \u003ca href=\"http://protocols.io/\"\u003eprotocols.io\u003c/a\u003e is not peer reviewed and may not have undergone a formal approval of any kind.
