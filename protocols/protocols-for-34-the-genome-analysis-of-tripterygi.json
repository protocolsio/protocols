The active ingredient celastrol is a friedelane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid with putative roles as antitumor, immunosuppressive, and antiobesity agent. Here, we report a reference genome assembly of <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. wilfordii<\/span><span> with high-quality annotation by using a hybrid sequencing strategy, obtaining a 340.12 Mb total genome size, a contig N50 reaching 3.09 Mb. We successfully anchored 91.02% of the sequences into 23 pseudochromosomes using Hi-C technology and the superscaffold N50 reached 13.03 Mb. In addition, we annotated 31,593 structural genes, and a repeat percentage of 44.31%. Comparative evolutionary analyses showed that <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. wilfordii <\/span><span>diverged from species of Malpighiales approximately 102.4 million years ago.
