However, although there are already much evidence of bladder dysfunction on this population, still there are not researches that adressess specifically bowel dysfunction on children with CZS. Thus, a research protocol was developed based in our experience on neurogenic bowel treatment in children. After approval by the ethics committee the protocol was tested during  bowel function assessment of microcephaly by CZS patients admitted for ambulatory follow-up on Rehabilitation Specialized Center of Anita Garibaldi Center of Education and Research in Health (CEPS) from july to december of 2019. The protocol of bowel function evaluation followed Rome IV Criteria for children and adolescents, applied through clinical anamnesis and physical examination, Bristol Stool Scale of classification based in symptoms for bowel functional disturbs and rectal ampoule ultrasound. So far, neurogenic bowel was confirmed on 90% of assessed patients. Our findings reveal new data about the subject, increasing the need of additional researches that deepen scientific knowledge abou multiple repercussions of CZS.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1585091284}
