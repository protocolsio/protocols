However, telerehabilitation for respiratory diseases and respiratory infections is not known. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. The COVID-19 is one of respiratory tract disease, and rapid and widespread transmission was demonstrated. Therefore, it is necessary consider telerehabilitation in patients with respiratory tract disease in the acute phase in hospital as well as chronic phase from the perspective of infection prevention.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Aim<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of this scoping review is to assess the intervention program, safety and feasibility of telerehabilitation for patients with respiratory tract diseases in the COVID-19 era.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods and analysis<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We describe this protocol that follows the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement. We also use the scoping review framework by The Joanna Briggs Institute following five stage approach: (1) identify the research question; (2) identify relevant studies; (3) select studies; (4) chart the data and (5) collating, summarize and report the results.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ethics and dissemination<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In this scoping review, only data from previously conducted studies will be analyzed. We will publish this scoping review in peer-reviewed journals.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1589014438}
