No purified protein recovered<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">There are several possible explanations for recovering no protein. Often, the His-tag may be rendered inaccessible as a result of protein folding. The recombinant protein can also be insoluble as a result of overexpression. In both cases, the protein can be purified at denaturing conditions (see below). On rare occasions, the protein is bound to the His-Affinity Gel too tightly and can not be eluted with the supplied His-Elution Buffer. A custom-made elution buffer containing 500 mM imidazole or 100 mM EDTA may elute the tightly-bound protein. Also, check your DNA construct for errors.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">4. Low yield of purified protein<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Protein folding may hinder the binding of the hexahistidine tag to the His-Affinity Gel. In this case, unbound protein is found in the flow-through or wash fractions. Lowering the imidazole concentration of the His-Wash Buffer to 25 mM (e.g., by dilution with His-Binding Buffer) may increase yields. Alternatively, in rare cases, the protein is bound to the His-Affinity Gel too tightly and can not be completely eluted with the supplied His-Elution Buffer. A custom-made elution buffer containing 500 mM imidazole or 100 mM EDTA will help to solve this problem.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">5. Eluted protein is not pure<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Check your buffers for signs of contamination, and check the pH of the buffers. Also, make sure that centrifugation drains the His-Affinity Gel completely after each spin (some older centrifuge models may require longer centrifugation time). If the problem persists, add an additional wash step in the purification protocol, or increase the imidazole concentration of the washing buffer to 60 \u2013 100 mM (e.g., by dilution with the His-Elution Buffer).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">6.
