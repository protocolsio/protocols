Questions prompted podiatrists to discuss their decisions leading up to acceptance of current job role and what attracted them to the job. Additional questions focused on locality, preconceptions of location, concerns of working environment, career aspirations and local and professional support. Interview questions for stakeholders were undertaken individually via telephone and prompted discussion about recruitment initiatives, perceived effectiveness of initiatives and and satisfaction with these initiatives. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Procedure<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Waves data collection<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">We trialled the core data sets at each wave with four podiatrists who work in public and private sectors to determine any phrasing or flow challenges. Minor amendments were made to how questions were worded, no content was changed. Potential podiatrist participants were recruited through University graduates lists, Australian Podiatry Association email outs, social media and special interest groups. Participants were invited to participate in survey Waves conducted approximately 1 year apart. Survey data were collected online via Qualtrics\u00ae software (Qualtrics, Provo, UT, USA). Each participant self generated a unique participant number based on their initials and date of birth and responses linked between survey waves and directed to data collected through Qualtrics and privacy policies. Forced or requested responses were used to minimise missing data. Cookies are used by Qualtrics to allow responses to be saved up to 4\u2009hours within partial completion. Qualtrics\u00ae also routinely collects Internet Protocol (IP) addresses as part of the de-identified metadata in the survey response. It was not pre-planned to routinely use or view IPs however if participant's self generated code was in a form where data was unable to be linked from code alone, IPs were viewed and used as a last resort to match data together with age, gender, postcode and training institution.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The survey tool was be adapted from questions asked in the MABEL longitudinal survey of Australian doctors [7]. The first wave enabled collection of basic demographic data, current employment (hours of work, practice ownership), preferences for job types (public\/private or mixed), areas of interest of specialisation, practice ownership and location of work, personality, finances and family circumstances and job satisfaction and work-life balance ratings. Participants were asked to identify past responses which dictate question logic. The subsequent surveys,  gathered information on variables that can change over time, for example work location or mix of public and private work undertaken and enable analysis of factors predictive of change. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Surveys used logic to minimise survey fatigue through two key questions relating to if the participant has changed their job or changed where they lived. Where the participant responded those circumstances remained unchanged, they were not re-presented with the survey items relating to job satisfaction, workplace environment or postcode of where they lived. Participants were incentivised through a competition process at each wave, due to the length of the survey (approximately 45 min).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Podiatry focus group interviews. Participants (sample size determined as n=20) who met the focus group criteria from Wave 1 were invited to participate in focus groups during the first year of the project. Participation was at a convenient time to both parties. Recruitment to focus groups occurred via a workshop at the Australasian Podiatry conference, via special interest groups etc.), and by participants stating agreement to be contacted on the survey. Focus groups explored factors affecting choice of work location. Semi-structured questions explored: How they decided about their work location choices, what benefits and supports facilitated their choice, what strategies should be included in regional promotion of workplaces as employers of choice and who should lead this?
