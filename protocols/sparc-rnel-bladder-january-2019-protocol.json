Stimulation frequencies and amplitudes can be determined using a binary search procedure. In the binary search, include electrodes where stimulation produced CAPs on the pelvic and pudendal nerves. Use a stimulation frequency determined by the minimum response latency found during the single amplitude survey. Increasing the stimulus frequency minimized the amount of time required to perform the experiments.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA9F6C","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":705138,"guid":"C77103A0299111E9A63311AD08645D4C","previous_id":705137,"previous_guid":"C770DC90299111E9A63311AD08645D4C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"805B2DB1EF634146921A07E5A5534F72","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Electrical stimulation"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"432AB3F45D2640D38C756A24F2373C25","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">For each electrode, use a binary search algorithm to identify the minimum stimulus threshold that results in a detectable response in each instrumented nerve. 300 individual stimulus pulses are typically sufficient for averaging.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":705139,"guid":"C7712AB0299111E9A63311AD08645D4C","previous_id":705138,"previous_guid":"C77103A0299111E9A63311AD08645D4C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"4239BE2731EE4920BA28F9958232C933","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Electrical stimulation"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"7B9FD84B35554BFDB4443519C12011A2","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Stimulation was applied to monopolar electrode configurations, as well as multipolar configurations, to localize current below the electrodes stimulated.
