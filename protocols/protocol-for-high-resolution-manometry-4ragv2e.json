A high-resolution manometry catheter taped with a wax film (Parafilm ‘M’ laboratory film; Bemis, Neenah, WI, USA) to a Perspex rod was inserted into the lumen of the specimen. The rod was fixed in the organ bath with the catheter placed against the mucosa. A suture thread with an attached alligator clip was secured to the anal and oral ends of the organ bath. These clips attached to oral and anal end of the specimen to hold it in place (Figure 1). Between 3 to 4 isometric force transducers (depending on the specimen length) were attached to the superior aspect of the specimen, using alligator clips tied to silk threads, and spaced evenly along the length of the specimen (~5-7 cm intervals; details below; Figure 1). The clips were attached to the serosa in between the taenia coli. A resting tension of ~5g was applied to each transducer, which lifted the colon up causing maintained contact between the manometry catheter and the mucosa. While, both the high resolution manometry catheter and force transducers recorded mechanical colonic activity, data were only analysed from the manometry catheter. In 12 recordings, two suction electrodes were applied the colonic serosa for extracellular recording of colonic smooth muscle action potentials (Figure 1).\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":74,\"length\":3},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":189,\"length\":1},{\"style\":\"sub\",\"offset\":252,\"length\":1},{\"style\":\"sub\",\"offset\":259,\"length\":1}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1luuq\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"du9ha\",\"text\":\"Specimens equilibrated in the organ bath for 20 minutes.
