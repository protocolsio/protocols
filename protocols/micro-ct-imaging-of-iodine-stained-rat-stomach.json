The Quantum GX2 will allow for fine adjustments to position (forward\/backward, left\/right, up\/down) that can be accessed in Live Mode. For the highest pixel\/voxel resolution, it is necessary to reduce the field of view (FOV) to as small as possible while still capturing the entire stomach. Using Live Mode allows the user to preview the scan by rotating the beam\/detector position around the stomach prior to actual scanning, so it is useful in determining the smallest possible field of view. With the exception of particularly large stomachs, most rat stomachs can fit within a 45 mm field of view (which yields 90 \u00b5m voxel resolution), but some may require a 60 mm FOV, or in extreme cases, a 72 mm FOV.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA94FF","section_duration":0,"critical":[],"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":855093,"guid":"409A26A016D911EAA9BDFFB3E6DE460D","previous_id":855092,"previous_guid":"408D074016D911EAA9BDFFB3E6DE460D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"ECD97335E0794C468A3DB828FB4D1D09","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Scanning"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"C24A671476EE4167B74766C59FEB351B","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Set the scanning parameters to High Resolution, with at least a 14 minute scan time.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA94FF","section_duration":0,"critical":[],"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":855095,"guid":"40B501A016D911EAA9BDFFB3E6DE460D","previous_id":855093,"previous_guid":"409A26A016D911EAA9BDFFB3E6DE460D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"AE0881BE4DA7428DBBE2BEAEAA421389","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Scanning"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"37814112A20041F4808FDDBEAC2E4040","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Use Live Mode to view the orientation of the stomach, and use buttons located on the front of the scanner to alter translational position.
