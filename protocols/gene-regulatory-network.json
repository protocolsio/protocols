We used a multiomics approach, which has the power to identify the control mechanisms underpinning complex traits (Argelaguet et al 2019; Lloyd-Price et al 2019). We also utilised a Systems Biology approach to co-analyse genes with evidence of differential behaviour using seven categories that included expression (DEGs), changed methylation at gene bodies (DMGs) or promotors (DMPs) and differential chromatin accessibility (DACs) into gene network. To focus the analysis towards investigation of key regulators, we also performed regulatory impact factor (RIF) analysis (Reverter et al 2010). This used co-expression correlation between TFs and their target differentially expressed genes to identify master regulator TFs. For gene network inference, genes were used as nodes and significant connections (edges) between them were identified using the Partial Correlation and Information Theory (PCIT) algorithm (Reverter & Chan 2008) considering all samples.

Key regulators are likely to undergo substantial change in their number of connections and identify gene networks driving the transition to maturation. This prompted construction of separate networks for each physiological stage, before identifying those genes that underwent the largest change in connectivity of differentially connected genes (DCGs). <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Argelaguet, R. et al.
