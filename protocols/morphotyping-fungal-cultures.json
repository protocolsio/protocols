For this reason, careful assignments should be made from observations collected at different times and DNA data collected from multiple isolates per morphotype and per beetle.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">After isolation of fungi from beetles, fungi need to grow to sufficient size to allow for elucidation of macroscopic characteristics (ie color, size comparison\/growth rate, texture, etc). Additional methods for differentiation morphotypes may be deployed at this step, including culturing duplicate dilutions in darkness vs. fluorescent (+blue-black-blue) light.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Subculture<\/span><span>: 5-10 days post isolation<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Before subculturing, create preliminary morphotypes by recording the original isolation plate # and the phenotype on the back of a subculture plate.

In pure culture\/at a larger size, subcultured fungi may display slightly different phenotypes than those observed on isolation plates, and may allow for re-assessment of preliminary morphotypes (or grouping order in RAPD gel).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">After DNA extraction, perform a RAPD PCR reaction (M13 primer & cycling) by grouping similar morphotypes next to each other on the gel.
