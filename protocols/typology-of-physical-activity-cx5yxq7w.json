definition of health is “a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being” (Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization, 1946, p100). Physical activity has been shown to benefit a wide range of aspects across these three major health dimensions. For example, physical benefits of an active lifestyle include a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (Reddigan et al,. 2011), colon and breast cancer (Lemanne et al., 2013), obesity (Jakicic \\u0026 Otto, 2005), and greater physical functioning through improved muscular strength (Latham et al., 2004) and mobility (Yeom et al., 2009). Mental benefits of physical activity may include improved cognitive functioning such as memory (Nagamatsu et al., 2013), attention (Schafer et al., 2006), executive functioning (Guiney \\u0026 Machado, 2013), protection against cognitive decline in old age (Sofi et al.,2011), and other benefits such as quality of life (Pucci, 2012), sleep (Kline et al., 2013) and stress reduction (Rueggeberg et al., 2012). In addition, physical activity has been linked with social health. Enhanced social relationships (Sandford et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2004) and greater social activity (Shiovitz-Ezra \\u0026 Litwin, 2012; Pucci et al., 2012; Podewils et al., 2005) all appear to be positively related to a physically active lifestyle. Physical activity benefits also extend to aspects of health that require combinations of physical, mental and social functioning, such as functional independence (Ip et al., 2013; Paterson \\u0026 Warburton, 2010; Lui \\u0026 Latham, 2009; Arcoverde et al., 2008) and ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) in old age (Burge et al., 2012). One of the most commonplace definitions of physical activity is “any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure” (Casperson et al., 1985, p126). The frequency, intensity, time and type (FITT) of physical activity are typically recorded as specific measures. The frequency, intensity and time aspects are generally well-researched (often summarised as level of physical activity, or expressed as energetic expenditure), leaving physical activity type largely under-researched. The most common method of classifying the type of physical activity is to categorise activities into one of the three broad categories: endurance (also referred to as aerobic and cardiovascular exercise); strength (also referred to as resistance or weight training), or; flexibility (also referred to as stretching or mobility training). However, the demands of different types of physical activities vary far more extensively than that which can be accounted for using such broad classifications. Physical activities differ in terms of their mental (eg. attention, memory, decision-making, reaction time), physical (eg. strength, flexibility, balance, coordination) and social (eg. alone, in a group, with an instructor) demands, which may relate to different mental, physical and social health outcomes. Some physical activities have different/greater underlying mental demands compared to others. For example: golf requires the ability to read the greens, make tactical decisions and keep score; dancing requires the ability to interpret music, lead/follow a partner and remember choreography; archery requires focus and attention to strike the target; football requires team strategy, communication and decision making skills to score goals in a time-pressured situation; and tennis requires prediction and fast reaction time to counteract an opponent’s moves. These examples portray more mentally demanding activities, whereas simpler activities such as walking and running may be considered less mentally demanding. Physical activities can be characterised by their physical demands on endurance, strength and flexibility, and in terms of their demands for skill. For example: yoga requires extensive flexibility but also static balance; tennis requires not only aerobic fitness and strength, but also agility and dynamic balance; and dancing requires extensive coordination of limbs to execute movement patterns. Increased understanding of the importance of these physical skills has resulted in their inclusion in major physical activity guideline institutions, e.g. the American College of Sports Medicine’s (ACSM) recommendations for physical activity in older adults includes balance training alongside aerobic, strength and flexibility training (Wojtek et al., 2009). Some physical activities are also inherently more social than others. For example, team sports such as football and basketball not only require social interaction with a team and an opposing team, but participation also requires direct, purposeful and strategic verbal and non-verbal communication and teamwork in order to achieve a common goal. Running with a friend may include social interaction and communication, but communication itself is not integral to the activity. Some types of dancing have an intrinsic social element, where a participant is required to follow the direction, or lead a partner, in a close spatial area. Going to the gym alone may result in incidental social interaction, whereas using a stationary cycle at home may be completely socially isolated. Physical activity is a complex, multifaceted behaviour (comprised of mental, physical and social demands). Activities with different combinations of mental, physical and social demands may well produce different effects on health outcomes. Several Cochrane reviews identify the need for investigation into the type of activity and its effect on a range of health issues, including dementia (Forbes et al., 2015), physical functioning (Lui \\u0026 Latham, 2009) and Health Related Quality of Life (HQRoL) in cancer survivors (Howe et al., 2011). To date, the non-metabolic demands of different activity types have been poorly conceptualised. Detailed analysis of this important health behaviour is scarce. Limitations in detailed physical activity classifications compromise our understanding of how this complex behaviour produces mental, physical and social health benefits.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":85912,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"6","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":1752012,"guid":"A53B441131F411EEABA435C50B53DED5","previous_id":1752011,"previous_guid":"A53ACEE131F411EEABA435C50B53DED5","section":"\u003cp\u003eTypology of Physical Activity\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"5oavd\",\"text\":\"Purpose of the study: This Delphi study aims to generate a typology of physical activity types that quantifies the different characteristics of each.

In order to counteract problems associated with drop-outs, the upper end of the suggested panel size will be adopted. Panel sizes of around 20 participants (selected via strict inclusion criteria) have been considered appropriate where panel members have similar training and general understanding in the field of interest (Atkins et al., 2005). Therefore, sample of expert participants (n=40) will be recruited from the UK and wider western nations via non-probability sampling techniques to form two expert panels: (n=20 MEN: cognitive experts to provide data on mental and social demands of different activity types; and n=20 PHY: physiological experts to provide data on physical and social demands of different activity types.

Delphi Method The Delphi method, or Delphi technique, is a widely used and accepted method for attaining consensus of expert opinion in real-world knowledge (Hsu \\u0026 Sandford, 2007). Questionnaires are individually submitted to participants of an expert panel. Once completed and returned, the researcher compiles data into summaries, which are then anonymously recirculated to the panel alongside each individual respondent’s data. This allows panel members to: (i) ensure that their views are correctly interpreted; (ii) acknowledge the views of fellow panel members, and (iii) edit their responses after viewing the data from the rest of the panel. This process would constitute one round. For more detailed exploration/consensus-building of the topic area, additional rounds may follow. While there are no specific guidelines and many variations exist, a classical Delphi is characterised by anonymity, iteration, controlled feedback, and statistical aggregation of group response (Skulmosky \\u0026 Hartman, 2007). In a Delphi method, round one often uses an inductive approach whereby participants are at liberty to offer ideas with complete freedom in their responses (Hasson, 2000). While this approach has many advantages, it has been criticised for its inability to produce the level of information that could be generated by a thorough literature review (Miller, 2000; Wheeller et al., 1990). Thus, this study uses a modified Delphi technique, whereby preselected items drawn from the existing literature are used to form a structured, round one questionnaire. This modification is considered both acceptable and common (Hsu \\u0026 Sandford, 2007). A thorough investigation of the existing literature was undertaken to identify mental, physical and social demands, which were then placed in structured, quantitative questionnaires. This modification is advantageous in that it improves the initial round response rate, and provides a solid grounding in previously developed work (Custer et al., 1999). Round One: Mental (attention/concentration, memory, decision-making and strategy, speeded reactions), physical (flexibility, balance, coordination, speeded reactions) and social (social interaction) demands of different physical activity types identified from the existing literature. It is possible that the cultural differences within the sample may lead to varied interpretations of these demands. Therefore, these demands will be clearly and succinctly defined in the questionnaires. Participants will be asked to rate how much each activity type requires each of the listed demands (MEN participants: mental and social demands only; PHY participants: physical and social demands only). The list of different physical activity types will be extracted from Ainsworth’s (2011) Compendium of Physical Activities. For each activity type, participants will be asked to rate the likely demand on each individual (mental, physical or social) demand (1=little/no demand; 2=moderate demand; 3=high demand). For example for the activity “Golf”, participants would be asked to rate how much golf involves attention/concentration, procedural memory, speeded reactions, flexibility, balance, social interaction and so on. Round one questionnaire findings will be compiled and a summary of results circulated to all participants alongside each participant’s individual responses. Participants will have access to the anonymous responses from all other participants, and will be given the opportunity to clarify or change their own ratings on the basis of this feedback. While a universal level of agreement does not exist for Delphi (Hasson et al., 2000), Sumison (1998) recommends consensus should be equated with agreement between 70% of respondents. Thus, items that are scored in agreement (70% mean score agreement) will be deemed to have reached consensus and will not be further investigated. Remaining items will continue to be explored in subsequent rounds. Rounds Two and Three: Participants will be asked to review the feedback from round one (outlining how the other participants rated each activity type) before completing a second questionnaire that asks them to re-rate the non-agreed physical activity items on all mental, physical and social demands, and state (where required) justifications for their scores. Again, items that are scored in agreement (70% mean score agreement) will be deemed to have reached consensus. Remaining items (if any) will progress to round three.
