The segmentation is achieved by computing the velocity profile associated with the marker of the second metacarpal head of the dominant limb and used as signal for detecting movement onsets and offsets. Then, all the movements are aligned by considering the EMGs with 0.25s before the task onset and 0.25s after the respective offset [-0.25s; +0.25s]. The data from 16 sEMG channels are filtered to extract the EMG envelope. Afterwards, the EMG envelopes are further analyzed to extract the phasic component of the EMG, removing the postural (tonic) EMG activity from the original signal. In order to perform the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), negative phasic EMG values are set to zero before synergy extraction. Since Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC) is very hardly measured on some muscles, the normalization of the data is performed on the maximum value achieved for each muscle in the complete dataset (“Global Normalization”). Then, synergies (time-invariant spatial loads W) and temporal coefficients (C) are extracted using NMF algorithm. For each subject, the extracted spatial synergies in Free and Assisted conditions are matched by similarity so that each synergy is coupled with the more similar one found in the respective dataset. Then, each couple of matched synergies is assigned a similarity score (cosine product).
