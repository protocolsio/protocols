Mice were perfused with at least 150 mL 40 °C phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 M PBS, pH = 7.4) via a blunt 18-ga needle inserted to the left ventricle, and blood was drained by cutting the inferior vena cava.

After the perfusion, the stomach was removed from the visceral cavity and trimmed to include the distal lower esophageal sphincter and the proximal pylorus. The entire stomach was then opened with a longitudinal cut along the lesser and greater curvature into two equal halves (dorsal and ventral parts) and any food or residue in the stomach was removed by rinsing thoroughly with DI H2O.
