Congenital malformations, intracranial hemorrhage grade III or IV, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis were excluded. Intervention group (GI) received an oral stimulation program of tactile extra-, peri-, and intraoral tactile manipulation once a day for 15 minutes, during a 10-day period. Control group (GII) received sham procedure with same duration of time. Feeding ability was assessed by a speech-language pathologist blinded to group assignment.
