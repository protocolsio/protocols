Confidentiality of participants will be maintained; participants\u2019 names will be removed from data for analyses and identifying codes will be stored on password-protected computers. Biological specimens will be collected and processed by trained professionals and analyzed at certified laboratories in India. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used to determine the effect of a biofortified food basket on the described outcomes. Advanced analyses will use mixed models to account for covariates of interest (e.g. recipe intake, age, sex, feeding center). We will use restricted cubic splines to plot dose-response curves to detect any non-linearity associations or threshold effects. Non-parametric tests will be conducted as required in the case of non-normally distributed data.

The DSMB will monitor the study and periodically evaluate the progress and outcomes of the intervention. Endpoints considered to define safety and efficacy to establish unblinding and stopping guidelines, as per the DSMB, include: 1) diagnosis of development of severe acute malnutrition; 2) occurrence of all-cause death; 3) demonstration of efficacy by a significant beneficial effect on child\u2019s growth (height-for-age and weight-for-length Z-scores) or hemoglobin concentrations. All (serious) adverse events will be reported via (serious) adverse event forms. When a (serious) adverse event occurs, study personnel will undertake all necessary precautions to ensure safety and well-being of study participants.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ethics and dissemination<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This study is approved by Arogyavaram Medical Centre Institutional Ethics Committee (IR800009889), the Cornell Institutional Review Board for Human Participants (Protocol 1508005782), and the Indian Council of Medical Research (5\/9\/37\/Indo\/FRC\/2017-Nut) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The nature of the study will be explained to potential participants, and all mothers will provide signed, written and video-recorded informed consent prior to any study procedures.
