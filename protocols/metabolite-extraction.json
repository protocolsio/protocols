The bacterial cultures were centrifuged and washed to remove traces of remaining media. Cell pellets were then sonicated at amplitude 30%, pulse 10 seconds, gap 10 seconds, for a total time of 2 minutes: 30 seconds or 15 Cycles in 300 \u00b5L of 1x PBS. The samples were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 20 minutes and the supernatant was separated. The metabolites were precipitated using acetonitrile in twice the volume of the supernatant by incubating at -80 \u00b0C overnight. The clear supernatant was centrifuged, transferred into new tubes, followed by air drying(27). These dried samples were further given for LCMS.<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1596655886}
