Background<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Patients-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is defined as a mismatch between the patient breathing efforts with a ventilator\u2019s breath delivery. (1) PVA is a common problem in mechanically ventilated patients, (2, 3) which could potentially induce the exhaustion of diaphragm and respiratory muscles and deliver high tidal volume to the lung leading to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). (4, 5)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The impact of PVA on clinical outcomes varied depending on the timing of evaluating PVA. (6, 7) Utility of closed-loop-ventilation such as Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) and Proportional Assist Ventilation (PAV) which usually reduces PVA was shown to be associated with better outcomes in the weaning phase of mechanical ventilation using partial ventilation. (8, 9) In contrast, the impact of PVA in acute phase of mechanical ventilation on clinical outcomes were not similar across studies. Thille AW et al. reported that higher incidence of PVA was associated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation, while this was not associated with mortality. (2) Conversely, Blanch L et al. showed that ICU mortality of the patients with higher incidence of PVA was significantly higher than that with lower incidence of PVA. (10) Furthermore, to date, there is no systematic review regarding PVA in the acute phase of mechanical ventilation.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Therefore, we will conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the impact of PVA on specific clinical outcomes and the effect of interventions in order to improve PVA for mechanically ventilated patients in the acute phase of mechanical ventilation.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">2.

These titles and abstracts will be screened independently by two authors who will discard any studies which are not applicable, although any studies and reviews which might include relevant data or information on trials will be retained initially. We will contact the authors of these studies in order to assist in the screening of these studies if necessary. Two authors will then independently assess the remaining abstracts and, if necessary, their full texts, to determine whether they satisfy the inclusion criteria or not. The two authors will then compare their lists, and any differences in opinion between them will be resolved by discussion and, if this fails, through arbitration by a third author.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.4.2 Data extraction<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Data extraction will then be carried out independently on the studies selected for inclusion by two authors using standard data extraction forms. Again, we will contact authors of these studies if necessary during this process, and any differences in opinion regarding data collection between the authors will be resolved by discussion, or through arbitration by a third author if required. If more than one publication of a given study exists, the reports will be grouped together and the publication with the most complete data used in the analyses. If relevant outcomes have only been published in earlier versions of studies, these data will be used, and any discrepancies between the published versions will be highlighted.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.5 Risk of bias assessment<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Part A.

If the author is not known, the standard deviation is calculated from the confidence intervals and t-values using the method described in the Cochrane handbook(17) or supplemented by a validated method(18). Alternatively, the standard deviations are complemented by the validated method(18). The validity of these methods will be verified by a sensitivity analysis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.9 Assessment of heterogeneity<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will calculate I2 as a measure of variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance, and interpreted the values as follows: 0%\u201340%, negligible heterogeneity; 30%\u201360%, mild-to-moderate heterogeneity; 50%\u201390%, moderate-to-substantial heterogeneity; 75%\u2013100%, considerable heterogeneity. If heterogeneity is identified for an outcome (I2 >50%), we will investigate the underlying reasons and conduct the \u03c72 test, with a p value of <0.10 being considered to indicate statistical significance. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.10 Assessment of publication bias<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will search trial registers (the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Platform Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov) to identify completed but unpublished trials. If more than 10 studies are included in this review, we will perform a funnel plot analysis and will use Egger's test (a p value of < 0.05 being considered to be statistically significant for a two-sided test) to assess reporting bias.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.11 Meta-analysis\u00a0<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will conduct all analyses using the STATA version 16 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will use the random-effects models for all analyses.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.12 Subgroup analysis<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will also carry out prespecified subgroup analyses according to the following variables.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">1.
