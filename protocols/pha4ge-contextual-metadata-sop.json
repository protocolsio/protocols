Many of the contextual data elements described in the PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification are critical for effective public health surveillance and response. However, many of these same elements have ethical, practical, and privacy issues which must be considered before data can be shared. Data governance policies may vary between data types and jurisdictions, thus users of the specification should consult data stewards and privacy officers regarding organization-specific and jurisdiction-specific policies. Below, we highlight a series of common issues and provide suggestions for ways forward. The PHA4GE Reference Guide should be consulted for field-level guidance.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Note: This guidance is based on the experience of members of the PHA4GE working groups, and is not intended to apply to all situations and use cases. Decisions regarding implementation of the specification must ultimately be made by the user in consultation with data providers and data stewards. If the intended use of the information collected is for research purposes, there will likely be many additional administrative and ethical requirements (e.g. Research Ethics Board (REB) review). <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Identifiers and Repository Accession Numbers <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sharing consensus sequence and raw data, as well as contextual data, with public repositories enables tracking of global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, phylodynamic analyses, development and improvement of diagnostics, and much more. Laboratories world-wide are sharing SARS-CoV-2 sequence and minimal contextual data with public repositories such as GISAID and the INSDC. When you share information with a public database, you will receive an accession number (a unique identifier in a database enabling the tracking of multiple versions of the data). If you have shared data with a public database, make sure to capture the accession numbers. GISAID will provide you with a single accession number. Make sure to record it. INSDC members (NCBI, ENA, DDBJ) may provide you with different accession numbers depending on what you share, and how. You can share assemblies and consensus sequences with GenBank (and its equivalents), raw data with Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and contextual data as a BioSample (see reference guide for further information). Information may be organized in BioProjects, and at a higher organizational level, Umbrella BioProjects. Make sure to record all of the applicable accession numbers.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Samples, libraries, patients, sequences (raw, processed, consensus etc) and so on can have many identifiers, especially if there is a division of labour or sharing of information across agencies and organizations. The specification has provided fields to capture many of those that are common, but may not capture all of the IDs you require. <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">It is essential to track IDs of original materials and information<\/span><span> to establish chain-of-custody and for follow-up, if necessary. It is better to track too many IDs than too few. If you require more fields to capture the IDs you need, add them. Some IDs are considered public health identifiable information (PHII). Make sure to check with the appropriate authorities whether the IDs you plan to share are considered identifiable information. If considered identifiable, you may need to create an alternative set of IDs. If you do, make sure to store the key in a safe and secure place. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Geographical Information<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Geographical information (country, province\/state\/region, city, postal code, latitude\/longitude etc) is very informative for tracking spread of the virus at different scales. Detailed geographical information for human clinical samples is often considered PHII depending on the number of cases in that locality, or may be specially regulated, and so must be abstracted before it can be shared. If the specification is being used for a sequencing project and detailed geographic information can be recorded, additional standardized fields such as geo_loc name (city), geo_loc name (county), host contact information (postal code) can be added to your collection template as needed. It is important to note that most geographic location fields in the specification <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">describe the sample<\/span><span>. Other fields have been provided to capture geo_loc information about the origin of the host and the likely country of exposure. Curators should ensure that the information they are entering correctly refers to the sample or the host. Before sharing data, especially with public repositories, it is important to ensure the data being submitted complies with the permitted level ofgranularity. Discuss this with the data steward. If sharing latitude and longitude coordinates, do not use the centre of the city\/region\/province\/state\/country or the location of your agency as a proxy, as this implicates a real location and is misleading.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The \u201chost residence geo_loc (country)\u201d \u201clocation of exposure geo_loc name (country)\u201d, and \u201chost ethnicity\u201d can be highly sensitive. If the information is shared and patients re-identified, it can have extreme consequences for the patient, the data collector, the data provider, and political relations. However, this information is important for characterizing risk, understanding transmission, and how the disease impacts some groups more than others (i.e. due to systemic health care inequity, poverty, racism etc). There may also be issues of equitable access and benefit sharing that should be considered for genomics data, particularly regarding Indigenous communities. Institutional, national and international resources regarding these issues should be consulted for best practices.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Date Information<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Geographical and temporal information are key elements of infectious disease surveillance programs. Temporal information consists of dates e.g. sample collection date, sample received date, sample sequenced date, symptom onset date etc. Dates can be considered PHII on their own for human clinical samples, or in combination with other types of contextual data (e.g. geographical information), or in context of how many cases have been reported in a locality. Sharing \u201cSample collection date\u201d along with sequence data is highly desirable, however If this date is considered identifiable, it is acceptable to add \"jitter\" to the collection date by adding or subtracting calendar days as required. Do not change the collection date in your original records. Furthermore, elements such as \u201csample collection date\u201d are usually held by the institution that collected the original specimen (e.g. performed the diagnostic test). As such, you may require permission to acquire this information, or it may be difficult to attain due to other burdens on the data provider (workload, system access, manual curation requirements). Alternatively, \u201dreceived date\u201d may be used as a substitute in the data you share.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Purpose of Sampling\/Purpose of Sequencing<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sampling strategy can create biases in the data. A sample may be collected for one purpose, but sequenced for another (e.g. collected for diagnostic testing, but sequenced for surveillance of circulating lineages and variants). Information about why samples were collected and why they were selected for sequencing (i.e random vs targeted sampling) can help inform epidemiological modelling and analyses. Standardized tags are available in the \u201cpurpose of sampling\u201d field (e.g. Diagnostic Testing, Research, Surveillance) and in the \u201cpurpose of sequencing\u201d field (e.g. Baseline surveillance (non-random sampling), Screening for Variants of Concern (VoC), Cluster\/Outbreak Investigation). Free text fields are also available for providing extra information about sampling and the selection of samples for sequencing called \u201cpurpose of sampling details\u201d and \u201cpurpose of sequencing details\u201d. A number of standardized phrases are also suggested in the Reference Guide for describing different common surveillance priorities.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Host Information<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Outside of specifying the species\u2019 scientific or common name, human host information is almost always considered PHII. Patient information is usually collected at the time of specimen collection (e.g. diagnostic test) using a case report form, and held by the institution that collected the original specimen. You will more than likely require permission to acquire this information, or it may be difficult to attain due to other burdens on the data provider (workload, system access, manual curation requirements). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u201cHost age\u201d and \u201cHost gender\u201d are regularly collected for most surveillance programs and can be used to characterize case definitions, and for linkage between lab and epidemiological data. On their own, this information may not be considered PHII, however, they may be considered identifiable information when combined with other contextual data such as collection date and geographical location. Abstracting age information by using age binning is acceptable in the specification. Suggested age bins are as follows: 0-9 years, 10-19 years, 20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, 70-79 years, 80-89 years, 90-99 years, and 100+ years.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Information about whether an individual was asymptomatic or symptomatic, and known health outcomes can be recorded in the \u201chost health state\u201d field, while information about whether they were hospitalized, medically isolated, self-quarantining etc can be recorded under \u201chost health state details\u201d. Sharing of these types of information in aggregated form is often permissible, however sharing of these data types at an individual level, along with information about signs and symptoms, pre-existing conditions and risk factors, and complications, are usually restricted.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Host Exposure Information<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The context of pathogen exposure is very important for understanding transmission chains and for determining public health actions. An individual may be exposed through direct or indirect contact with an infected person at an event, in a particular location (exposure setting) through a variety of contexts (host roles), or through travel. This information is usually highly sensitive.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Methods Information<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Methodological information, such as sampling and experimental design, laboratory procedures, bioinformatic processing, and quality control metrics, are crucial information to understand the context and limitations of analyses. Capturing as much well-structured information regarding your methods, and storing it in a centralized place (or single document) helps to future-proof the data as well as the work that went into collecting, processing, analyzing and interpreting the data. Capturing methodological information also enables better reproducibility, and increases quality control. The specification provides many fields for capturing experimental design, protocols, and scientific metrics. It is strongly recommended that as much of that information be captured and stored as possible. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;:UNDERLINE;\">Null Values<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The International Nucleotide Database Collaboration (INSDC) have created standardized <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ena-docs.readthedocs.io\/en\/latest\/submit\/samples\/missing-values.html\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">missing\/null value reporting language<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> to be used where a value of an expected format for sample metadata reporting can not be provided.

In determining how a virus spreads, it is critical to track temporal and geographical information. It is also important to capture as much data provenance (who contributed it, where it came from, how it was generated) as possible. Different sampled materials or sampling processes may contain higher viral loads or produce better results, and differences in sampling protocols and practices should be accounted for (e.g. to understand sampling effects on interpreting a genomics-based cluster, to identify mutations due to viral passage in the lab). A number of recommended and optional fields are provided to capture sampling methods (\u201cpurpose of sampling\u201d, \u201cspecimen processing\u201d, \u201clab host\u201d, \u201cpassage number\u201d, \u201cpassage method\u201d). We highly recommend including information regarding whether the virus was passaged, and how. Seven fields have been introduced to capture different kinds of anatomical and environmental samples, as well as collection devices and methods.
