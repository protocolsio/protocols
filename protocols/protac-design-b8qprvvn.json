A PROTAC molecule consists of two key domains: the domain that specifically binds to the target protein that needs to be degraded, and the domain that binds to the E3 ubiquitination ligase, which is linked by a specific linker. Unlike traditional small molecule inhibitors, which can only regulate the activity of target proteins, PROTAC can directly degrade target proteins through the protein destruction mechanism of cells themselves. Intracellular proteins with abnormal structure or function are labeled with polyubiquitin by a series of enzymes, which are then transferred to the proteasome for degradation.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"key\":0,\"offset\":59,\"length\":30}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ci3jg\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"g4a2\",\"text\":\"As a leading service provider in drug discovery and research, BOC Sciences is fully capable and committed to providing one-stop proteolysis targeting molecular drug discovery based on chimeric (PROTAC®).
