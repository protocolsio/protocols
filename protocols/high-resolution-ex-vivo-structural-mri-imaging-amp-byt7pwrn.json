Cell counting is obtained with both traditional immunohistochemistry, to provide a stereological gold-standard, and with a custom-made inverted confocal light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM) for 3D imaging at cellular resolution. Finally, mesoscale optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables the registration of the distorted histological cell typing obtained with LSFM to the MRI-based atlas coordinate system.

A foot sealer is used to create 3 parallel seals, we take care to ensure the seals are smooth and high quality - that is to say there are no areas where the plastic is burned and no crinkles are present. Next, we use the sample as a template and mark off with Sharpie on the bag the general outline of the sample. Then, the foot sealer is used to create a second set of seals, at ~30 degree angles sealing off the two bottom corners of the bag. We slide the specimen into the bag, with the cortex against the smooth side of the bag to minimize damage and bubbles. Next, we insert a strip of aluminum foil into the opening of the bag and center it. We take care not to slice the sample with the foil. The foot sealer is used to create a set of seals near the top of the sample, at ~45 degree angles, sealing off the top two corners of the bag, except for where the foil strip is placed. Next, we remove the foil and pour in the scanning solution (PLP or fomblin, depending on project requirements). As solution is poured in, the bag is manipulated and the sample is turned over to ensure any big bubbles escape - especially around the ventricles. We continue to add liquid and then take breaks to move the sample around and allow more air to escape. We make sure to add enough solution so that it fills the canal where foil was placed before - this extra solution will be vacuumed out later. We create a fifth set of parallel seals at the opening of the bag and then use a dedicated tool to pierce a hole in one side of the bag and mark this area with a Sharpie. A vacuum beaker, vacuum nozzle and vacuum tube are then connected to a fume hood vacuum system. The vacuum tube is placed over where the bag is pierced. A few iterations of the following are performed: we vacuum air out of the pack, seal the hole with tape, massage the sample to release bubbles from the sulci and move them up into the vacuum area before vacuuming them out. After doing this ~3 times, we will tape over the hole and leave the sample to sit for a few days in the refrigerator. Closer to the scan date, we remove the sample and perform a final vacuum. When we are confident that no bubbles are visible in the pack, we tape over the hole a final time and use the foot sealer to create a sixth set of seals which are below the piercing and parallel to the sample, sealing off the area where any air could creep back into the pack. Excess bag is trimmed off and the sample is left for 12 - 24 hours to heat up to room temperature before scanning. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"desp1\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-center\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"37tr3\",\"text\":\"Figure 1: Example images from a hemisphere packed in Fomblin (left) and PLP (right)\",\"type\":\"align-center\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":83}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"e8m04\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-center\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"bjoi4\",\"text\":\"    \",\"type\":\"align-center\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[{\"key\":0,\"offset\":0,\"length\":1},{\"key\":1,\"offset\":2,\"length\":1}],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"bc5nl\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"97qms\",\"text\":\"A paper will be published soon on the specifics of these methods.

A selection of specialized coils is also available forex vivoMR microscopy as well as primate imaging.  The system has multinuclear imaging capability, and coils for 31P and 13C are available.  The system has been upgraded by Siemens to contain 8 independent 1kW transmit channels capable of simultaneous parallel excitation with different RF pulse shapes for B1 shimming and/or parallel transmit methods such as transmit SENSE. The 7T scanner environment includes a visual display system and a button box for acquiring subject responses in the scanner.
