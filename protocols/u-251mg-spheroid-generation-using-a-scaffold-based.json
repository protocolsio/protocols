Once they have been grown, these 3D cells can be used to screen for small molecule drugs or for genetic modification in for analysis of disease pathways or to predict drug treatments toxicity or efficacy. 3D cell cultures are a big step towards the more ethical testing of drug toxicity and efficacy as they decrease the need to use animals in research as well as providing more reliable results as the cells used are of human physiology.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Cellusponge are 3D porous hydroxipropylcellulose scaffolds that are designed for use with cells that do not require specific ligands. As well as the standard non-coated cellusponge, there are two more of the same type of scaffold available for use that are made with two different coatings to allow for improved adaptation of different cell types, these are called Cellusponge-Gal and Cellusponge-Col.
