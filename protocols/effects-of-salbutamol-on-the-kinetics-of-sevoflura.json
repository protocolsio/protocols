class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation, which is not completely reversible and develops progressively. A survey of 102230 adults in rural areas of northern and central China showed that COPD accounted for about 3% the population aged 15 and over, and the prevalence rate COPD people aged 40 and over was 8.2 %.COPD results mainly in excessive pulmonary inflation, limited airflow and abnormal gas exchange. Lung function examination showed total lung volume (TLC), functional residual volume (FRC), increased residual volume (RV) and vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV) in the first second.   Because of the above pathophysiological changes in the respiratory system in COPD patients, COPD patients undergo a slow increase in intra-alveolar anesthetic concentrations during inhalation anesthesia, decreased uptake through alveolar capillary membrane transmembrane, causing a low concentration of \"effector sites \"(e.g. brain) drugs. The anesthetic depth is not easy to deepen or to reach the predetermined level within a certain period of time. Moreover, during the anaesthesia recovery phase, the concentration gradient between capillaries and alveoli decreases due to airflow obstruction. The patient had a delayed recovery, poor recovery quality (e.g., irritability after waking) or delayed respiratory depression, even life-threatening events occur.  Salbutamol selectively stimulates the \u03b22 of bronchial smooth muscle receptor, mainly used to prevent and treat bronchial asthma or asthmatic bronchitis. Salbutamol in the treatment of COPD patients, can improve lung function, improve exercise tolerance, improve the quality of life has been verified. Recent studies suggest \u03b22 receptor agonists increase FEV1To FVC, reduce RV \u3001FRC and improve airflow patterns in COPD patients.  This study was to explore whether salbutamol pretreatment can change COPD respiratory mechanics and lung volume, and affect the wash-in, uptake and elimination of sevoflurane. Whether it is beneficial to improve postoperative pulmonary function.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1148451,"guid":"305EB8E08B0A11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","previous_id":1148452,"previous_guid":"33ECE8B08B0A11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6AACA37E523F4AF09BAD5CAA38FAC59F","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Research protocols"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"EA86B832836D4FA3AF06C14F42FB5A45","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Types of research<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical studies<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Primary outcome<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Ratio of inhaled sevoflurane concentration (In<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">sevo<\/span><span>) to end-expiratory sevoflurane concentration (Et<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">sevo<\/span><span> )\uff0cnamely the F<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">A<\/span><span>\/F<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">I <\/span><span>fraction.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Secondary endpoints<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(1) The time of opening eyes, extubation and oral birthday of patients in anesthesia recovery room.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">(2) Number and incidence of pulmonary complications within 7 days after operation.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1148452,"guid":"33ECE8B08B0A11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","previous_id":1148449,"previous_guid":"041DAE808B0A11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"A2F7470B34BF4E2B88375B655B515607","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Research protocols"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"FE04F73E9F41491BB8DD8B1ACEA29DE5","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Research Methodlogy <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.2.1 Research site<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Shaoxing People's Hospital<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">3.2.2 Research participants<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1148461,"guid":"4371E1908B0B11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","previous_id":1148451,"previous_guid":"305EB8E08B0A11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"2F33252C463249F0886D7DAF2ABE994A","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Research protocols"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"BB5179495714493195A338FD45AC24BF","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Research participants<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><span>80 patients with mild to moderate COPD with recruited in the study.<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1148462,"guid":"6702CCF08B0B11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","previous_id":1148465,"previous_guid":"8168A7808B0C11EBBD4DD9E86938A398","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"E3A8BAD2441E428AA47AD5DFF4360969","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Research protocols"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"A4C4C69F0A414F6EA28A1403615466B2","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Main research methods<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Salbutamol (40 vial) and its similar in appearance placebo (40 vial, normal saline) were used in this study.
