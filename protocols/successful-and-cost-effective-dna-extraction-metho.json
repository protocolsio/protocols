There are several protocols for efficient DNA extraction published by researchers, which might be helpful for others working in the relevant field. There are also some  commercial kits optimized to extract DNA even from low volumes or less amount of tissue. Research has conventionally showed that Phenol:  chloroform: Isoamyl alcohol (PCI) method gives good yield and is cost effective as compared to other methodologies, especially commercial kits. Hereby is the CTAB and  PCI protocol, which gives good yield from insect tissue preferably legs,  head and wings (avoid using whole body).<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1587308771}
