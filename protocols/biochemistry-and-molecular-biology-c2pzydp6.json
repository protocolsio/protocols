Subsequently, the samples were electrophoresed at 75 V for 3 h at a cold temperature and further transferred onto NC membranes for immunoblot analysis.\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"71mca\",\"text\":\"\\n\\n\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":88537,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":0,"number":"12","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":1803538,"guid":"8EE1358847804DB7BB84E82013D28B65","previous_id":1803537,"previous_guid":"96C9BC73F27E4D9F99DB254B21E06785","section":"\u003cp\u003ePreparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"5o15h\",\"text\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1s4dg\",\"text\":\"The assays were performed with a NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
