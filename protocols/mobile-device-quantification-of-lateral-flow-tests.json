The test sample apparatus generally comprises a holder base arranged that accommodates a tablet or cell phone. The apparatus has a hood that is placed over a portion of the tablets illuminating touchscreen such that the illuminating touchscreen provides light that can be collected by the hood. There is a chamber integrated with the hood adapted to accommodate a chemically activated test strip. The chemically activated test strip is illuminated when the hood collects light from the illuminating touchscreen. A lens in the hood interposed between the camera and the test strip enables the camera to focus on a portion of the chemically activated test strip when the hood is placed over the portion of the illuminating touchscreen.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The following are the claims from the inventor, Donald C.
