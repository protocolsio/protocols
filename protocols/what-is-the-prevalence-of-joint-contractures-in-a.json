A Cochrane review in 2010 found moderate to high quality evidence that stretching techniques had no immediate, short or long-term effects on joint range of movement, pain, spasticity, activity limitation, or quality of life in those with and without neurological conditions(13). Another Cochrane review that determined the effects of passive movements on contractures was not able to conclude clear benefits on joint range of movement(14).Some classifications of contracture have been subject to more thorough research and are therefore better understood. Volkmanns contractures \u2013 a shortening of muscles in the forearm resulting in deformity of the hand, fingers and wrist \u2013 were defined in the early 20th century(15), and there is no evidence showing genetic factors associated with the development of the Volkmann\u2019s contractures(16, 17).Alois Alzheimer identified contractures in patients with late stage dementia, observing them curled in a foetal position(10). Some individuals with advanced Alzheimer\u2019s disease have been observed to adopt increasingly flexed postures, which is associated with high prevalence of contractures; it is not known if there is a genetic influence in this form of contracture development(4, 18).Despite the fact that contractures in various forms have been prevalent and the topic of discussion for centuries, there is much less research available for older populations(19), particularly older people living with frailty and functional impairment in long-term care.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">It is worth noting that different studies utilise different definitions of contracture, and it is not always the case that researchers provide the definition or the method of assessment. It is important to consider factors such as the age of studies, the setting, as well as geographical location, as differences in care standards could contribute to differing prevalence(20).Wagner (2010) researched contractures in the care home by way of systematic review, and discovered that epidemiological studies vary in their definition of contracture(19), and this variance leads to distorted prevalence rates.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">In the 1980s in some cultures such as the USA it was standard care provision to restrain residents physically and chemically, especially those who may display challenging behaviours, and there have been multiple studies showing a relationship between immobility and contracture development(21-24).It is suggested that the immobility drives the contracture development, aswhen the muscle surrounding joints is held in a shortened position (flexed state), there is a loss of sarcomeres, fibrous adhesion formation, and a loss of tissue extensibility(25). There is some evidence that challenging behaviours are associated with contractures, this may be an indirect relationship mediated through imposed immobilisation as a result of restraint(26). Restraint practices have changed over time, and whilst current practice dissuades the use of restraints, there are both physical and psychological ways that residents can be restrained. One example would be the use of bed rails to prevent residents from \u2018wandering\u2019, or simply leaving mobility aids out of reach(27).These cultural care practice changes could explain some of the variation in prevalence over time such as the increased prevalence in the 1980s and 1990s, a number that decreased in the early 2000s; Selikson (1988) showed care home contracture prevalence as 71%, Mollinger and Steffen (1993) as 75%, and Wagner 2010 as 29%(8, 28, 29).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Wagner et al (2008) used data collected in a study on bed rail use to study factors associated with contractures in care home patients. In this study, contractures were defined as lack of full active and passive joint range of movement [ROM]. Of the 273 bedrail users measured, 60% had at least one contracture(9).They found several variables associated with contractures on univariate analysis and these included being non-white, using Medicaid, a longer length of stay, poorer function and mobility, lower levels of activity and higher levels of pain. They were also more cognitively impaired, more likely to be receiving physical restraint and have had a stroke or urinary incontinence. On multivariable analysis, only being non-white and experiencing pain were found to be significantly associated with contractures. In Offenbacher\u2019s review, the two main reported risk factors for contractures in older people were immobility and the presence of a neurological condition such as stroke(7). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Despite the variations in perceived prevalence of contractures, research shows the lowest estimate of contracture prevalence in residential care is 29% (29).In 2017, it was estimated that 410,000 people in the UK were in residential care(30), therefore, according to this definition, a minimum of 118,900 people are likely to develop contractures, and the associated complications. If the prevalence is 75%, as suggested by Mollinger and Steffen, this number increases to 307,500(8).This variation in possible prevalence ensures that any future studies regarding contractures will have to choose which prevalence figure to utilise and for further research to be useful, prevalence must be more accurately quantified. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The aim of this paper is to use existing published data to determine the prevalence of contractures in older people living in long term care homes. This understanding may allow for a better picture of the scope of contractures in care homes, which would potentially allow for more appropriate treatment and management strategies to be developed and evaluated in future research \u2013 by determining a prevalence, it allows the scope of the burden to be identified, and strategies to be put in place such as further training for care providers. Previous work by the researchers have set the definition of contractures as follows: any reduction of range of movement around a joint relative to age-matched norms for range of movement (ROM), that cannot be explained by injury of either the nervous system or the musculature, or by skin conditions such as congenital fascial dystrophy; a disorder wherein thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues can restrict ROM)(31).Severe contracture is to be defined as a loss of range of movement of 50% or more of the full range, or a contracture that can cause limitations in the provision of care \u2013 such as difficulties in providing hygiene care due to the inability to extend a joint sufficiently to clean in the skin folds \u2013 or ability to complete activities of daily living \u2013 the actions needed to manage basic physical needs including toileting, ambulating and eating(32).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1068921,"guid":"EACA5CD01ED511EB995E1D49F247297C","previous_id":1068919,"previous_guid":"B9F0B7801ED511EB995E1D49F247297C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"FAE4DD6B24D44B8A945E6423737D9756","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"65894D2E5BB0453784526FA3DCE3E0AE","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Specific Objectives<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">To carry out a systematic literature review to determine:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ol style = \"list-style-type: decimal;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">An update on prevalence of contractures in people living in care homes.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Identification of risk factors for developing contractures. <\/li><\/ol><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1068922,"guid":"0861BDB01ED611EB995E1D49F247297C","previous_id":1068921,"previous_guid":"EACA5CD01ED511EB995E1D49F247297C","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"FB6273BE8F6248B18B45DCC27228E1C7","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"79AC40C97FA84FABAC97F05DF633627F","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Inclusion Criteria <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The population to be researched are residents of care homes, with a cohort with a mean age of >65 years.
