discharge. We describe a protocol for a systematic review for a question: Does follow-up after ICU discharge improve long-term outcomes and mental health compared with usual care in ICU patients and informal caregivers?<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Methods and analysis<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">We will follow the Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis 2020 for conducting the research. We will search the literature on MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and APA PsycInfo systematically.We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effect of follow-up after ICU discharge for patients and informal caregivers.Follow-up after ICU dischargewill beany service and program whichinclude psychological monitor, care and intervention. Primary outcomes for patients and informal caregivers were depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and all adverse events. We will assess the certainty of evidence based on the Grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation approach for each patient and informal caregiver.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Ethics and dissemination<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">As this research is a SR\/MA of literatures, ethical approval is not necessary.
