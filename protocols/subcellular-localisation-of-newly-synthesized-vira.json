class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol allowed the subcellular localisation of viral RNA synthesis in coronavirus-infected cells by EM autoradiography, though it is largely applicable to other types of EM autoradiography samples. Newly synthesized viral RNA is metabolically labelled by providing the infected cells with tritiated uridine while arresting cellular transcription. Subsequently, the samples are processed for EM, sectioned and incubated with a photographic emulsion. Radioactive disintegrations from the labelled viral RNA generate signal around the radioactive source that, after development, becomes apparent as electron-dense grains that can be detected by transmission electron microscopy. The advantages of this approach are its high sensitivity and its compatibility with high-contrast EM sample preparation protocols. The protocol presented here is an adaptation of different methods and tips to EM autoradiography discussed in detail by Williams, in Glauert, 1977, Practical Methods in Electron Microscopy, Volume 6, Chapter 4.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1591718797}
