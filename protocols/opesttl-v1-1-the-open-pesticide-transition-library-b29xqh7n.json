Today, disjointed libraries of pesticide transitions can make it challenging to develop new methods between instrument vendors. From the combined experience of thousands of  separate pesticide screening assays performed by this author, I have compiled a library of over 4,000 pesticide transitions for various instruments. These transitions are presented here in the form of the Open Pesticide Transition Library (OPestTL) along with optimized transitions and settings for insturments from 5 separate instrument vendors. Exact masses are also provided for screening with high resolution instruments in the form of the 3 most common adducts for these compounds. While a growing work, PestTL represents the single largest open library of pesticide transitions assembled to date. \",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"bfni9\",\"text\":\"These transitions are for research purposes only and are intended to help speed method development.
