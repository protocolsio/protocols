(de las NievesPereiraVallejos et al 2017) The CBC places a strong focus on clinical teaching as a crucial tool for helping students develop their clinical competence. In order for students to obtain the necessary clinical competencies, the training setting needs to be real, fully furnished, and provide sufficient assistance from instructors, supervisors, and the clinical team.
