most common causes of the acute abdomen at an emergency department. Women of reproductive age who present acute lower abdominal pain need gynecological examination for the diagnosis of acute PID. It is not well-known how accurate imaging modalities such as contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are for the diagnosis. If these modalities have enough diagnostic accuracy, they can alternate diagnostic tools from the gynecological examination. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Purpose<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic imaging for acute PID among women of reproductive age.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods and analysis<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This systematic review was adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) statement. We will include all studies on the diagnostic accuracy of pelvic imaging for evaluating acute PID. The target participants are women of reproductive age with acute lower abdominal pain who are suspicious of PID and required gynecological examinations. The target condition is acute PID including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and pelvic peritonitis. We expect studies conducted in emergency settings. The index test is pelvic imaging as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI. The reference standard is gynecological examinations defined as examinations by gynecologists using standard diagnostic criteria with or without laparoscopy or transcervical endometrial biopsy. The quality of studies will be evaluated by QUADAS-2. We will present a summary table of evidence, estimates of sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence interval, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The meta-analysis will be performed using a hierarchical summary ROC model.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Ethnics and dissemination<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Data from previously performed studies will be analyzed.
