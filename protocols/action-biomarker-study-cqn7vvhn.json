A considerable effort within ACTION was the collection of new omics data in children with low and high aggressive behavior. To this end, the ACTION project included large-scale collection of biological samples in children from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), a twin cohort from the general population, and a cohort of children referred for psychiatric treatment (LUMC-Curium). Together these cohorts comprise the ACTION Biomarker Study.
