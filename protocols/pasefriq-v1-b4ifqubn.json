For the greatest reduction in background coisolation interference in the TMT6 and TMT10/11 plex standards, 10 ion mobility ramps from 0.8 to 1.3 1/k0 provides the greatest reduction in interference on 60 minute LC gradients when using a 25cm IonOpticks aurora column. Reducing the number of ramps to 5 leads to an overall increase in peptide identifications with a loss in unique protein identifications. It is worth noting that the distribution of 1/k0 of peptides labeled with the TMT6/10/11plex and TMTPro reagents have somewhat different overall distibutions.
