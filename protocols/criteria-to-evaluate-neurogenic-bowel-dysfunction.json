Studies have confirmed the presence of neurogenic bladder in children with microcephaly and CZS (COSTA MONTEIRO, 2018; 2019). Considering the frequent association between bladder and bowel dysfunctions (MACHADO, 2016), their common embrionary origin and their similar sympathetic (L1-L3) and parasympathetic (S2-S4) innervation, it would be expected that patients with CZS and neurogenic bladder may also present bowel dysfunction. However, we didn't find published studies that have specifically addressed bowel dysfunction in children with CZS and bladder dysfunction. Therefore, we developed and tested this research protocol, based on accumulated knowledge in the treatment of patients with neurogenic bowel for other causes, and also in the treatment of patients with CZS. This protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee (CAAE-17583419.7.0000.5537) and has been used as part of the investigation methodology of bowel dysfunction in CZS children admitted for ambulatory follow-up on Anita Garibaldi Center of Education and Research in Health (CEPS). The Bowel Function Assessment Protocol includes extended clinical anamnesis with guiding questions related to signals and symptoms of functionals disturbances, detailed physical examination, Bristol scale and rectal ampoule ultrasound.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This protocol is part of a research in progress at CEPS.
