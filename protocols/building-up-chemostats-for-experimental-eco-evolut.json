The dilution rate is depending on the volume inside the chemostat and the volume pumped in and out per day (volume pumped per day depends on tube width used for the peristaltic pump and the pump speed). With a dilution rate of, for example, d=0.1 you  exchange 10% of  the medium in 24h. Check the pump manual to set up the intended dilution rate. In addition, consider the growth rate of your organisms to prevent extinction, if the dilution rate is higher than the growth rate the organisms will be washed out.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">A example for a specific dilution rate: <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Total chemostat volumen: 400 ml<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Dilution rate: 0.5<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Pump tube diameter: 0.8 mm<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">RMP: this depends on the pump<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Medium renewal per day: 200 ml\/day  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">OVERVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL CHEMOSTATS<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/01f175848aa9c9678e8ee0006ed69b27cb4e3c72a3163619ed05a0b84f942b9f\/bsmuiei6.png\" \/><\/div><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"8F8FF363D07B4DDE91B84CE34BA0F6F4","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/01f175848aa9c9678e8ee0006ed69b27cb4e3c72a3163619ed05a0b84f942b9f\/bsmuiei6.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>Chemostats and other flow through culture systems are a powerful tool for the study of microbial and plankton communities in experimental ecology and evolutionary studies. Commercially available chemostat systems allow the control of a large number of parameters (e.g., ph, pressure, CO<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2<\/span><span> concentration) but are often expensive and offer a high level of control that is often not needed for many experimental studies. Non-commercial chemostats are more cost efficient, easily set up and flexible in volumes used. Different from semi-continuous culture systems, the flow through conditions of chemostats allow a constant inflow of resources from a reservoir (medium bottle) and outflow of unused nutrients, waste products and organisms, which are all collected in a waste bottle. Nutrient levels in the reservoir and the flow rate of the chemostat system (often referred to as dilution rate and presented as the fraction of the volume of the chemostat that is replaced per day) determines population growth rates and dynamics (for the theory behind chemostats see Smith & Waltman, 1995 and Weitz, 2015). <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>Chemostats have been used in a number of studies and with different organisms and combinations of organisms.

These chemostats are composed of four main parts: a syringe unit, a glass bottle (i.e. the chemostat), a medium bottle and a waste bottle, all connected by tubing. A peristaltic pump and a low overpressure in the system allow the flow of medium from the reservoir to the chemostat bottle and of unused nutrients, waste products and organisms to the waste bottle. Chemostats are put on stirring plates to create a homogenosus environment within.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Becks, L., Hilker, F.M., Malchow, H., J\u00fcrgens, K., Arndt, H., 2005.
