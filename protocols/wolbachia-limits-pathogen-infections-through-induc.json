At least 60 Mb clean reads of sequencing were obtained for each sample. Since no genomic sequence in any database was available for Cx. pipiens pallens, Trinity [29] was used to perform de novo assembly with clean reads, then Tgicl [30] was used on cluster transcripts to remove abundance and retain Unigenes. After assembly, Unigenes functional annotation was performed with 7 functional databases (NR, NT, GO, KOG, KEGG, SwissProt and InterPro), then all the clean reads of each sample were mapped to the Unigenes with Bowtie2 [31] software and the gene expression levels were calculated with RSEM [32]. Based on the gene expression levels, the DEGs (differential expression genes) between samples or groups were identified with PossionDis [33] (Fold Change >= 2.00 and FDR<= 0.001).
