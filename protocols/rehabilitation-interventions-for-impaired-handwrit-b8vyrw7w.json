Few studies investigated the effects of a rehabilitative training on handwriting or used measures of handwriting as an outcome in people with PD.\\nWe aim to conduct a scoping review to answer the following question: “What are the effects of a rehabilitative program on handwriting in people with PD?” \\n\\nMETHODS\\nWe will conduct a scoping review according to the five-stage methodological framework for scoping studies proposed by Arksey and O’Malley [4] and the relative additional recommendations by Levac and colleagues [5].\\n\\nInclusion Criteria\\nWe will consider any published paper reporting the results of a trial in which people with idiopathic PD received a structured rehabilitation program (i.e., more than a single session) of handwriting. We will exclude case reports.\\n\\nInformation sources and search strategy\\nWe will search MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) since their inception. The search strategy for PubMed database is in the Appendix.\\n\\nStudy records management, selection and data collection\\nWe will use EndNote X7 software [6] to manage citation records retrieved through the electronic searches. Two independent reviewers will determine studies eligible for the inclusion; any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or with the consultation of a third reviewer.\\nThe same two reviewers will extract general characteristics (publication date, study design, description of the intervention and comparator, sample size) and specific information (training characteristics, outcome measures and study results) of included studies on a standardized extraction form.\\n\\nRisk of bias assessment\\nTwo reviewers will independently assess the risk of bias of included studies. For randomized and non-randomized trials, we will respectively use the version two of the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB-2) [7] and the Risk of bias for non-randomized studies (ROBINS-I) tool [8]. Discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or with the consultation of a third reviewer.\\n\\nData synthesis\\nWe will present findings in a narrative summary. We will describe the characteristics of proposed trainings, the outcomes assessed and the efficacy of trainings in included trials.\\n\\nReferences\\n1. Thomas M, Lenka A, Kumar Pal P.
