This technique results in 20-40 cycles of amplification, where temperature changes rapidly and accurately. The first step in PCR amplification is denaturation, where double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is heated up to 96 C in order to create single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Denaturation allows primers to access the ssDNA. Primers attach themselves to a complementary sequence on the ssDNA during the Annealing phase. During Annealing, the thermocycler drops in temperature to around 50-60\u00b0C, this is an ideal temperature for primer attachment. The next step is DNA elongation, this step requires the thermocycler to increase to about 72\u00b0C. This temperature allows for the activity of our Taq polymerase; which is a DNA polymerase that only works at high temperatures. This cycle occurs 20-40 times and allows for the amplification of millions of DNA strands. One can estimate the amount of amplified DNA using this equation 2^n; 2 represents the initial 2 ssDNA while n represents the number of cycles performed. For instance, if there are 30 cycles performed then we can say 2^(30) and that we amplified 1,073,741,824 copies of the original strand of DNA.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">When designing primers, we will look at producing two distinct primers.

In the initial stage, these primers work the way that they normally would and prime on their respective strands. However, the priming of the forward outer primer and the structure of the forward inner primer causes the primer to loop amongst itself and hybridize forming a self hybridizing loop. The same process happens to the backward inner and outer primers, where the outer primer goes along the strand and causes the inner primer to form a self hybridizing loop. All of these primers working in tandem with each other then causes the target strand to form a dumbbell-shaped structure which then serves as a template for further LAMP cycling. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">For LAMP cycling, only the sequences that the inner primers recognize remain in this dumbbell structure. Therefore, the inner primers are the only ones that will continue to work and carry out this form of replication, where the inner prime continues this strand displacement activity, forming various products of various lengths in the process.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Resources<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/L5zi2P4lggw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Vd38iS_W7ww\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span class = \"embed-element\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/bNZboYn6f9g\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Disclaimer:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">The information provided on this document is intended for the educational purposes of the BME 22L laboratory course.
