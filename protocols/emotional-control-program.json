The subject seeks in performance, not only, to dominate the environment as himself, it is the achievement of excellence.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The application of psychological strategies allows an optimal adaptation to the requirements of the sport and competition, developing and optimizing the use of individual psychological and emotional capacities. Thus, the main difficulty in modeling performance is its multidisciplinary character, as well as the need to interact with the various factors implicit in its construction (Santos, 2017a; 2017b; 2018). Performance measurement is extremely difficult to obtain in view of the multiplicity of factors involved.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The observation of the player's activity in the competitive context is an argument of increasing importance, given that these data allow an analysis, aiming at the optimization of his performance (Garganta, 2001; Santos, Sarmento, Alves, & Campani\u00e7o, 2014). A good performance is expected when the intensity of the emotions is very close to the best (Robazza et al., 2004).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The relentless pursuit of improved performance, the promotion of adequate performance at the moment is the objective of the competitive context. But, above all, it is important to say that, whether in terms of sports performance, whether in terms of artistic or even scientific performance, achieving mastery or excellence is a factor of admiration on the part of those who watch this \u201cperformance\u201d. The physical and psychological variables specific to each individual can help to understand the specifics of the day-to-day variables and their idiosyncratic effects (Santos, 2019). The objective is a program suitable for emotional control, which results in control and the enhancement of personal and sporting performance. The intervention of a plan for the maintenance, reduction and impact of certain emotions integrates cognitive and somatic techniques, also having an intervention, and appealing to emotions and automatic symptoms, in order to place individuals in an optimal functioning area, ( Robazza et al., 2004).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The concept of emotion does not always have a definite consensus, the language of emotion is often ambiguous, often confused with other affective phenomena (Vallerand & Blanchard, 2000). Emotion will be a neural impulse that leads an organism to perform an action (Freitas-Magalh\u00e3es, 2007), however, Lazarus (1999) defines emotion as a complexity of disorders that include three domains: subjective affects, physiological behaviors in specific mobilized ways for certain actions and impulsive actions with a certain instrumental quality.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The role of emotion in the various aspects of human and animal cognition such as perception, attention, memory, decision making and social interaction is recognized as essential. However, emotion has been given greater importance in social interaction, however, neurophysiological research states that emotion plays an important role in the knowledge of the self's cognition (Gadanho, 1999).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Emotions can be a guide, an influence or a cognitive constraint, a regulation of attention that will modulate the performance of the task (Cai & Lin, 2011; Beauchamp, Harvey, & Beauchamp, 2012). Emotions interact and influence other domains of cognition, in particular attention, memory and reasoning. The psychological consequences and their mechanisms define the modulation of cognition (Dolan, 2002).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Emotions from a functional point of view have causes of motivational effect, and they can be understood as a variable between the assumption and its effect, but we must face them as an experiential-subjective component, as it is still necessary to know the relationship between emotion and cognition and what are their implications (Martins, 1999). Greater motivation is expected to achieve success, related to a protection that will increase the beliefs of effectiveness, an important factor that contributes to execute the protective action (So et al., 2016) and leading to a better performance (Santos, 2018). By knowing our emotions, we more easily realize how what we feel can affect what we do. Controlling emotions is crucial to our day-to-day lives. By identifying emotions, we can distance ourselves from them and thus have a better awareness of what we feel and understand why we feel, at the same time that we are not carried away by impulses that can harm us (Santos, 2017).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Strategy to handle emotions in building mental resistance<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Subjects rarely have control over the surrounding environment, however, they have the possibility to control their feelings, emotions and reactions to various stimuli and situations. The first situation will be to eliminate or minimize the negative source. Understand why this situation becomes negative for the individual and cancel the negative assessment (Conducting a non-stressful assessment; Requires a challenging assessment of competence; A threat assessment causes caution, but in itself, that does not impair performance success) .<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Mental Resistance is the ability to ignore elements of interference during day-to-day, event after event. The individual needs high levels of self-control, self-confidence, self-esteem and adequate levels of anxiety, perfectionism and reduced levels of abandonment. Thus, the following strategies are possible: Incentive to exercise and practice mental skills; The realistic definition of objectives; Think positively and create enthusiasm; Increase self-discipline (maintain self-control); Mental Visualization; Visioning of moments (perception of the best performances); Thinking about your practice would work; Reduce cognition during the execution of skills (thoughts and physiological responses do not interfere with the course of action that is performed naturally, the body is internally prepared to develop externally); The external focus must be focused on the task at hand; attribute success to internal causes; Use the stop of negative thoughts; Use positive models; Cancel states of helplessness and discouragement; Practice routines.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Emotions are part of life, a certain emotion can be positive or negative, facilitating or harmful, but it is sometimes necessary for optimum performance and for obtaining successful results. It is not intended to eliminate stress or any emotional variable that may seem less appropriate, but to manage its frequency and intensity. Concerns must be ignored, dissolved and \/ or postponed.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Protocol<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Emotional Control Program (PCE)<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Vasconcelos-Raposo, Carvalho, Teixeira, & Neto (2014) refer to the importance of mastering relaxation techniques, cognitive techniques such as Mental Visualization and Positive Inner Discourse, such as Biofeedback in the context of psychological interventions in psychotherapeutic programs.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">In accordance with these principles and in order to complement the intervention program, the Emotional Control Program (PCE) was developed based on the Bar-Eli & Blumenstein (2004 and 2005) five-step model. The genesis of PCE is introspection, internal dialogue and moment analysis, containing breathing exercises, TaiChi, Mental Visualization and Biofeedback (Biofeedback is applied with computer software, the Wave PC to monitor heart rates of the athlete).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Biofeedback (BFB)<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Biofeedback is a behavioral treatment that aims to directly change the mechanisms of the individual's physiology. Diamond (1999) says that Biofeedback refers to processes that are used to get individuals to train and control their body functions, such as blood pressure and brain wave activity, autonomic nervous system responses and of the central nervous system. Any change in mental and emotional functioning, whether conscious or unconscious, will result in a corresponding change in physiological functioning, any change in physiological functioning will have some impact on the individual's emotional and mental life (Golden & Consorte, 1982; Davies & Sime, 2005). Biofeedback is a method to increase perceptions of self-control, gain control over excessive and distracting behaviors and maintain attention in learning situations (Williamson, McKenzie, & Goreczny, 1986), and also allows for physical, psychobiological and parameters improvement. performance (Saha, Saha, Zahir, & Huda, 2015). Biofeedback allows small changes to be perceived and understood and thus to boost motivation and increase self-confidence. Samulski (2002) states that only Biofeedback offers the possibility of registering changes in terms of stress quickly and objectively. The athlete thus increases his sensitivity to changes and learns to focus his attention on the most important tasks. This method is used as a non-pharmacological treatment of headache and other pathologies and has revealed in several studies and meta-analyzes its superiority to pharmacological methods when associated with other relaxation techniques (Annequin, Tourniaire, & Dumas, 2000).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Blumenstein & Bar-Eli (2005) report that much research has found positive effects in the various forms of Biofeedback intervention in sports performance. Mostly it has been used extensively in the treatment of sport anxiety and is considered an excellent tool for the control of stress. Burton (1998) points out Biofeedback as an adequate tool to increase activation levels when they are too low.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The combinations of BFB with other psychological techniques are positive, more efficient and facilitative in sports performance or another context. BFB involves the autonomous and voluntary nervous system and provides information that would initially be inaccessible about the individual's biological status. Biofeedback is a tool for which only positive results were recorded, when combined with another technique (Stroebel, 1984; Beauchamp et al., 2012), when associated with Mental Visualization, it fosters positive Self-confidence and enhances visual Attention (Davies & Sime , 2005), such as a cardiac deceleration that coincides with a phase of attention and preparation for action (Moss, 2004).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Bar-Eli & Blumenstein (2004) refer that in a common study of some Biofeedback programs of 4 sessions of 60 ', 5 sessions of 30', 6 sessions of 20 'and 11 sessions 60', in a period of 14 weeks verified an increase in performance after 3 to 5 months of application. The Wingate 5 - step approach program is a mental preparation program with BFB and other techniques. The \"Wingate 5 - step approach\" program has shown in several studies despite the use of only the first 3 steps of the program to significantly improve. But when using the 5 steps of the \u201cWingate 5 - step approach\u201d program, unlike the 3 steps of the program, individuals revealed a more efficient increase in their performance (composed of 70\/75 training sessions over 7 to 8 months). The five steps of the \"Wingate 5 - step approach\" are Introduction, Identification, Simulation, Transformation, and Realization. Confirming the usefulness of this mental training program.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Mental Visualization<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The practice of Mental Visualization can lead an individual to change his behavior, if he includes many descriptions of the response in the description of the imagination, thus allowing access to the appropriate motor program, to anticipate the situation, to imagine the moment (Cruz & Viana, 1996).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The applications of Mental Visualization are very varied, not only through the act itself but also in the influence on other variables such as regulation and activation, acquisition and maintenance of motor skills (Driskell, Copper, & Morgan, 1994; Meaci & Price, 1985), in the way we imagine our success to foster a possible behavior change (Murphy & Martin, 2002; Omar-Fauzee, Daud, Abdullah, & Rashid, 2009), in the reduction of anxiety states (Schandler & Dana, 1983 ), motivation (Gammage, Hall, & Rodgers, 2000), concentration and attention (Murphy & Martin, 2002; Cruz & Viana, 1996) and recovery from injuries (Vasconcelos-Raposo et. al., 2014).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Mental Visualization can help performance in the following ways<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">:<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 See success - the subject sees and feels the success and the achievement of his goals, and thus believes that he is capable;<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Motivation - when viewing the images of the past and the future, these images can be a useful aid to maintain the consistency and intensity of the moment.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Energy level - to change the energy level, lowering the activation levels (relaxation) or increasing the activation levels.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Learning skills - to improve or learn new skills, correcting errors in technique or reducing the complexity of movements or gestures.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Focusing attention - due to distractions, there is a greater chance of focusing attention at the moment.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Preparation for an event - psychic need to prepare for the moment and for possible setbacks that may come up.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Evaluate performance - in the end, perform a review of the moment, and review what went well and what went less well.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">\u2022 Recovery from injuries - helps in the recovery of the outpatient process and in the continuation of tasks.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">TaiChi (TC)<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Tai Chi is an ancient oriental martial art, of self-defense, over time its purpose evolved into internal homeostasis and at this moment it is considered as a model of light and moderate intensity exercise. The TC is aimed at greater body awareness. The practice of TC in the elderly population as in other populations has favorable effects on the physiological effect (Zhang, Ishikawa-Takata, Yamazaki, Morita, & Ohta, 2006), balance control, flexibility, cardiorespiratory system, mental control and in the psychosocial aspect, improving the proprioception of the body system (Tsang & Hui-Chan, 2004a; Tsang & Hui-Chan, 2004b; Wang, Collet, & Laud, 2004; Taylor-Piliae & Froelicher, 2004). TC has an increase in flexibility and a psychological improvement, as in the improvement of moods and in the reduction of salivary cortisol concentrations (Jin, 1989; Li, Hong & Chan, 2001) in the increase of IgG in men and in the decrease of IgM in women. women, but it is not clear that it only has an effect on the components of relaxation and meditation (Sandlund & Norlander, 2000), we also know that there is a reduction in stress when we feel satisfaction and pleasure in carrying out activities, it is important to emphasize that in the entire literature review found benefits in adults, given that it consists of fluid exercises and relaxation occurs naturally (Sandlund & Norlander, 2000; Greenspan, Wolf, Kelley, & O'Grady, 2007).
