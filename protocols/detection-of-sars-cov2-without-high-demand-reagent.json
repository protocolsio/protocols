Arguably, the PCR based tests are the most reliable when it comes to detecting the virus. Critical reagents for these tests, however, are in short supply. Our group has worked to identify and test alternative reagents and supplies that are not in high demand by clinical labs. We have adapted a more traditional approach to isolating RNA does not use a kit. RNA isolated can be used in traditional quantitative PCR or droplet digital PCR, which has been shown to be ~500 times more sensitive. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1587416700}
