in prediction modeling techniques. One key difference being the approach to identify potential predictors based on a univariate analysis approach, which has potentially many limitations that would introduce bias. At the time the original SAP was determined (2013), this was thought the best approach by the research team, and was also the approach used in previous studies by this team at the time. These revisions were made before any assessment or analysis of the data were completed (before the data scientists even received the final dataset for analysis), and this protocol was written and published prior to the start of any data analysis steps.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">SAP in the original protocol initially approved by the IRB:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>\"Subjects will be dichotomized as injured or non-injured based on the injury surveillance data. Key demographic, physical performance (FMS, YBT, SFMA, Hop Test, MSRT, & Shuttle Run), and self-report measures will be examined for group differences. Independent t- tests will be used for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Variables with a significance level of P<\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\"><<\/span><span>.10 will be retained as potential predictors. This significance level was selected to increase the likelihood that no potential predictor variables would be overlooked. For continuous variables with a significant univariate relationship, sensitivity and specificity values will be calculated for all possible cutoff points and then plotted as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The point on the curve nearest the upper left-hand corner will represent the value with the best diagnostic accuracy, and this point will be selected as the cutoff defining a positive test. Sensitivity, specificity, odds ratios, and positive likelihood ratios (LRs) will be calculated for potential predictor variables. Potential predictor variables will be entered into a backward stepwise logistic regression model to determine the most accurate set of variables predictive of musculoskeletal injury status. A significance level of .10 will be required for removal from the equation to minimize the likelihood of excluding potentially helpful variables. Variables retained in the regression model will comprise the computerized algorithm for predicting those Service Members that are likely to experience a musculoskeletal injury. The Hosmer-Lemeshow summary goodness-of-fit statistic will be used to assess the fit of the model to the data and test the hypothesis that the model fits the data.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will further analyze the data to determine whether weighting individual predictors according to the relative size of the beta coefficients increases the prognostic accuracy of the model. Weights will be calculated by taking the beta coefficient for each variable in the final model and dividing it by the lowest beta coefficient and then rounding to the nearest integer. After the weight is formulated, an ROC curve will be used to identify the cutoff value that represented the best diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive LRs, as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals, will be calculated for the cutoff point that maximized the diagnostic utility of the weighting system.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Risk stratification (low, moderate, or high) will be based on LRs associated with the clinical prediction rule for injury outlined above.

Lower extremity and back injuries have stood out for their majority contributions to disability in the military. Deficits in movement quality following injury have been posited to mechanistically contribute to re-injury. The ability to identify which military tactical athletes are at higher risk to sustain a future injury is of high priority to military leaders and policymakers. Therefore, we chose to examine a group of service members who had sustained lower extremity or thoracolumbar injuries and had been cleared to return to full duty following those injuries. For the one year following their return to duty, we tracked new and recurrent injuries and related time off from work. Demographic, psychosocial, health, and physical movement measures captured at the time of discharge from medical care, at the beginning of that year, would then be analyzed to examine which combinations of variables would be able to predict future injury. This information can aid providers in care decisions when returning military tactical athletes to full duty following an injury.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This document outlines the statistical analysis plan for the study.

This would allow for enough subjects to be enrolled to account for any problems with baseline data collection and over\/under-sampling based on the unit-based data collection procedures used in this study.

Estimates from a healthy population estimate that approximately 20% of male and 40-50% of females Service Members will sustain at least one time-loss musculoskeletal injury over a one-year period. Since prior history of injury is one of the strongest predictors for re-injury, and all of our subjects will already have this variable present, we moved our conservative male injury rate from 20% to 30%, and expected to have successful completion of 135 subjects per specific cohort. We further estimated based on these numbers, that approximately 40 Service Members per cohort would sustain a time-loss injury, thus providing the potential for a robust 5-10 variable regression model per cohort.

A prediction model using logistic regression will be performed, with the occurrence of a time-loss injury as the binary outcome. Following primary model development, an elastic net analysis will be performed. Elastic net is a penalized method that assesses multicollinearity and shrinks the coefficients (down to zero) to reduce the risk of overfitting. Further, elastic net allows for predictor selection and incorporates these results into the overall model, and has been found to have improved results compared to more traditional statistical methods.To find the optimal alpha and lambda shrinkage parameters, tenfold cross-validation with ten iterations per fold will be performed, with the greatest Kappa used to determine the best tuning parameters. Models will then be internally validated to decrease optimism through bootstrapping with 2000 iterations or 10 fold cross-validation with 10 iterations per fold.

Discrimination will be evaluated by the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC).

It should be noted if data is categorized as missing not at random, multiple imputation will not be performed on these data, and will be potentially excluded from analyses. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":978863,"guid":"31BE42CBD81E4848ADAF7B27B72CA3A2","previous_id":978862,"previous_guid":"FD2E9201C2DD4CF99DE1C2D57DCF59E6","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"97DB7324B3C84FF98E474D04D6D1E3E7","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"2C9E46D608D74C3CB59EFE6C99DBAD68","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Additional Analyses:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Machine Learning <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Following primary model development, internal validation, and assessing model performance, four machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine Regression, Gradient Boosting Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks) will be developed to predict injury. All machine learning models will incorporate all the same predictors used to develop the logistic regression model. An iterative matrix process will be performed to assess optimal tuning hyperparameters for all machine learning models, with root mean square error utilized to determine optimal tuning. All models will then be internally validated to reduce overfitting with 10 fold cross-validation.

The net benefit is the fraction of true positives gained by making decisions based on predictions over a range of plausible risk thresholds. Within this study, the threshold probability will be defined as the population risk of injury within military personnel. As injury risk can vary between baseball players, the net benefit was calculated through a range of predicted risks. The net benefit of the prediction model will then be compared through decision curve analyses to assume all are at high risk (\u2018treat all\u2019) and assume all are at low risk (\u2018treat none\u2019). Further, the prediction model's net benefit will be compared to current military evidence-based practice guidelines.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":978864,"guid":"6D93DE0E5D2B4B7CB7733A270B523954","previous_id":978863,"previous_guid":"31BE42CBD81E4848ADAF7B27B72CA3A2","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6EF439A8C1854BF7BFE4C67A990B7F7A","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"9F1990EFC4CD444184CE7AD66888EA4A","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Harms:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">N\/A - this was an observational cohort; not a randomized clinical trial<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":978865,"guid":"7F30ECFC5FAE4D3B9E1580DE1A117A65","previous_id":978864,"previous_guid":"6D93DE0E5D2B4B7CB7733A270B523954","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"D19C3639C6D94612980E0A5C8191C75B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"956730BDFE5144ABA36FA1A2E1C68661","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Statistical Software: <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The computer software programs R and Python will be used for all analyses. <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":978866,"guid":"3FEDF1449D144499BA9F08A56D22F5AB","previous_id":978865,"previous_guid":"7F30ECFC5FAE4D3B9E1580DE1A117A65","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"52F343163A44426EB56AC8DE3E1B4561","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Analysis"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"5C5D43F5511B45E482779CCB31307E82","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">1.<\/span><span>Balabin RM, Lomakina EI.
