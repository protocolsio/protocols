Demographic data and clinical variables of all participants were summarized using descriptive statistics. Variables of interval-ratio data meeting normality assumption were compared using independent t test for gender difference. Chi-square test was used for analysis of categorical data of different gender. The results from the 6MWT that produced a higher 6MWD were used for statistical analyses. A total of five multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The first set of two analyses were performed to examine the unique contribution of HR or SV changes to the outcome variable \u2018change in CO\u2019, during the 6MWT and CPET. Forced entry regression method with HR change and SV change as predictor variables was used. The second set, which included three multiple linear regression analyses was conducted with VO2peak recorded during the CPET as the outcome variable to generate regression equations. In this set, the first regression equation was generated using age, gender, BMI, and HRpeak, SVpeak and COpeak measured during CPET as predictor variables. The second regression equation was developed with variables of 6MWD, age, gender, BMI, plus ICG recorded HR, SV and CO at the end of the better performed 6MWT as predictors for VO2peak. The third regression equation was created using 6MWD as the sole variable predicting VO2peak. A stepwise backward regression method was then adopted to determine the statistically significant predictor variables retained in the regression equations. The appropriateness and precision of the regression parameters were evaluated with the squared multiple correlation (R2), the standard error of estimate (SEE), and partial SEE (SEE%), which was \u2018SEE:meanVO2peak\u2019 ratio expressed as a percentage. The predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) statistic was computed to estimate the degree of R2 shrinkage when the VO2peak regression equation was used for cross-validation across similar but independent samples.
