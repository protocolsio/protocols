A single colony was later gram stained prior to biochemical testing in order to ensure the culture's purity. The pure single colonies were further analysed via biochemical tests (Indole, Citrate, Urease, Motility and Triple Sugar Iron Agar) together with a control Salmonella colony taken from the laboratory in order to make a comparison. A single colony of the organism was then saved in a cryovial containing Nutrient Agar at-70 \u00b0C. This was done per Salmonella spp. isolate found.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1598080209}
