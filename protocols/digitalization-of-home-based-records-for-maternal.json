the history of health services and key health information of an individual and through which health education messages can be shared. The record is kept by the individual or their parent\/caregiver at home, and is intended to compliment the records kept at the health facility. The great majority of these HBRs are paper-based, although many countries have future plans for digitalizing them for improved access and use, as well as higher rates of recording. In some middle- and high income countries, electronic HBRs are already being used in order to promote information sharing between providers to improve the integration in care, as well as reduce the risk of data loss. There is a need to better understand what efforts have already been undertaken in terms of the digitalization of HBRs and what lessons can be learned moving forward.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objective:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The main objective of this scoping review is to map the peer-reviewed and grey literature available on the digitalization of HBRs for MNCH.
