To test the neuroprotective activity of CNB-001 (0.1, 1 or 10 \u00b5M), cells were treated for 20 min before transfection and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00baC. For single-molecule experiments, 24 h after transfection, serum was removed for 2 h, and cells were treated with LIF (100 ng\/ml), Nocodazole (10 \u00b5M) or Latrunculin B (10 \u00b5M) for 2 h at 37\u00baC in serum-free medium. Cells were then incubated with JF647 (100nM), JF549 (100 nM) or PA-JF549 (1nM) HaloTag ligands in serum-free medium for 20 min at 37\u00baC.Subsequently, cells were washed twice with sterile PBS. At the end of the final wash, the medium was changed to Leibovitz\u2019s L-15 without phenol red.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1612375854}
