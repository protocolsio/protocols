Thus, for example, when GFP is expressed at a very high level, the GFP fluorescence signal can be detected even by a camera with a longer-wavelength emission filer. Such a leakage of fluorescence signals is called as bleed-through or crosstalk. It is critical to avoid such bleed-through signals as much as possible. The powers of 3 excitation lasers and the amplification gains of 3 image intensifiers should be independently controlled to minimize bleed-through.<\/div><br\/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1133745,"guid":"269FD940779311EBAEA2979EC23B721D","previous_id":1133741,"previous_guid":"EDC45650779211EB913AD786D9A15CAF","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"1E52B502266C4F30BA1446C0850E81C2","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Live cell imaging by super-resolution confocal live imaging microscopy "}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"6AA05C4C04474F8F8B800BF9981FE190","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">2D confocal fluorescence data are separated in the custom-made spectroscopic unit.

through the secretory pathway and delivered to their correct destinations is a central issue of cell biology. We have further investigated in yeast how two distinct types of cargo proteins are sorted into different endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites (ERES) for their differential ER export to the Golgi apparatus. We used an optimized protocol that combines a live cell dual-cargo ER export system with a 3D simultaneous multi-color high-resolution live cell microscopy called SCLIM (Super-resolution Confocal Live Imaging Microscopy). Here, we describe this protocol, which is based on the reversible ER retention of two de novo co-expressed cargos by blocking the COPII function upon incubation of the thermo-sensitive COPII allele <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">sec31-1<\/span><span> at restrictive temperature (37\u00baC). ER export is restored by shifting down to permissive temperature (24\u00baC) and the progressive incorporation of the two different types of cargos into the fluorescently labeled ERES can be then simultaneously captured at 3D high spatial resolution by SCLIM microscopy. By using this protocol, we have shown that newly synthesized glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins having a very long chain ceramide lipid moiety are clustered and sorted into specialized ERES that are distinct from those used by transmembrane secretory proteins. Furthermore, we showed that the chain length of the ceramide is critical for this sorting selectivity. Therefore, thanks to the presented method we could obtain the first direct in vivo evidence for lipid chain length-based protein cargo sorting into selective ERES.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1619125110}
