Inside-out signaling stimulates increases in the ligand-binding affinity of integrins [33]. Outside-in signaling by integrins occupied by immobilized ligands [34, 35] induces cell spreading, retraction, migration, proliferation, and survival [32, 35]. Integrin signaling requires both heterotrimeric and monomeric small GTPases [37]. Many viruses engage cellular receptors such as integrins to transit the plasma membrane by hijacking the intrinsic endocytic pathways of desensitizing receptors [38, 39]. Recent studies from our lab have shown that SNV engages the \u03b2<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">3 <\/span><span>integrin plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain and initiates integrin outside-in signaling downstream of G\u03b1<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">13 <\/span><span>activation [17]. In the setting of SNV engagement, outside-in signaling stimulates cytoskeletal remodeling, receptor clustering, internalization, and trafficking [17]. The signaling events involved GTP loading of several GTPases associated with integrin activation (Rap1) [<\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\">40<\/span><span>], cytoskeletal remodeling (RhoA, Rac1) [41], and cargo trafficking (Rab7) [42].

In this setting there are three different experimental conditions (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">see <\/span><span>Fig. 3b). 50,000 CHO-A24 cells in 48-well plates are treated with mP6 or with 0.1% DMSO (solvent for mP6) for 30\u00a0min. UV -inactivated particles of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) are added and the cells are incubated for 5\u00a0min at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The cells are lysed and GTP loading of four GTPases is measured as described in Sections 3.2-3.4. Lysis buffer is used to determine the aggregate nonspecific binding of the four reporter antibodies used to detect GTPases associated with the beads.

These signals ultimately combine to induce profound changes in vascular endothelial cells, including increased endothelial monolayer permeability [44, 47, 48]. High concentrations of thrombin expressed in the circulation of HCPS subjects significantly contribute to loss of cell barrier function in endothelial cells [18]. Argatroban, an orthosteric inhibitor of thrombin (<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;font-style:italic;\">K<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;font-style:italic;\">i<\/span><span>~ 10<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">\u22128<\/span><span>\u00a0M), can be used to block thrombin activity [49]. Because GTP loading of RhoA is associated with loss of cell barrier function, a set of beads were used to interrogate lysates of cells treated with an inhibitor of Rho kinase (Y27632) before exposing them to plasma samples. In a pilot study of a specific PAR4 antagonist, ML354 [50], we tested the G-Trap platform to determine the role of GTP loading of RhoA, Rap1, and Rac 1 on cell barrier function using telomerase-immortalized microvasculature endothelium (TIME) cells [17]. We first assayed the effects of plasma and PAR signaling inhibitors in terms of the status of cell-cell barrier integrity using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). We then correlate changes in cell barrier function to a time-course measurement of GTPase activity. As shown in Fig. 4b, ECIS measurements show that HCPS patient plasma caused loss of cell barrier function in TIME cells. The cell barrier function of Y27632-treated cells was conserved, consistent with normal activation of RhoA. ML354 treatment conferred only short-term barrier protection and argatroban supported long-term cell barrier integrity to cell monolayers (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">see <\/span><span>Fig. 4b). We measured GTP loading of RhoA, Rap1, and Rac1 in a multiplex format. The G-Trap assays show that the short-time (15\u00a0min) exposure of cells to plasma increased RhoA\u00b7GTP 15-fold, Rap1\u00b7GTP 7-fold, and Rac1\u00b7GTP 4-fold relative to active GTPase levels in resting cells (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">see <\/span><span>Fig. 4c). ML354 and argatroban limited GTP loading to ten-, five-, and threefold for RhoA, Rap 1, and Rac 1, respectively, in the short term. However, after 1-h exposure to plasma, the efficacy of ML354 at limiting GTP loading to the target GTPases is lost, while the activity of argatroban is conserved (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">see <\/span><span>Fig. 4d).

Activation of PARs results in cell barrier disruption (RhoA) whereas Rac1 and Rap1 signaling are believed to be barrier protective [57, 58].

During initiation of infection, bacterial adhesins favor tissue colonization, whereas, at later stages, exotoxins promote bacterial spread and blockage of immune cell responses [52]. By downregulating Rho GTPases, bacterial pathogens can block crucial immune cell functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation [12, 53]. Bacteria produce various toxins and virulence factors that activate or inactivate Rho GTPases by different mechanisms. The processes include (a) posttranslational modification of the GTPases; (b) bacterial protein mimics of GTPase regulatory factors, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs); and (c) modification of upstream regulators of Rho GTPases [1, 12].<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Here we test the applicability of the G-Trap assay for detecting bacterially induced GTPase activity in serial plasma samples from a de-identified septic patient (UNM IRB #13-312).
