HCT116 Red-FLuc cells were confirmed to be pathogen free by the IMPACT Profile I (PCR) at the University of Missouri Research Animal Diagnostic and Investigative Laboratory. HCT116 Red-FLuc cells have a mutation in codon 13 of the ras proto-oncogene, and express transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF\u03b21) and tumor protein 53 (TP53), HCT116 Red-FLuc cells grown in McCoy\u2019s 5a Modified Medium (ATCC, 30-2007) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and puromycin (2\u00b5g\/mL) have an average doubling time of 16 hours. For each experiment, cell stocks in liquid nitrogen at passage 2 were thawed using T25 flasks, expanded in T150 flasks for 2 days, passaged overnight and harvested at 70-75% confluency.

Two hundred microgram samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with 20 mM methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) in dimethylformamide (DMF) to block free cysteine thiols. Proteins were precipitated with 6 volumes pre-chilled (-20\u00b0 C) acetone for a minimum of 60 minutes to remove MMTS, pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 x g) for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0 C, and dried for 10 minutes. Following sample resuspension in HENS buffer (100 \u00b5l), S-nitrosylated cysteines were selectively reduced with ascorbate (protected from light) and irreversibly labeled with iodoTMTzero reagent for 2 hours at room temperature.
