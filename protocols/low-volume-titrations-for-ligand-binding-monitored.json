The synchrotron light source is ten times brighter than a standard xenon arc light source of benchtop instruments. The small diameter of the synchrotron beam can be up to 160 times smaller than that of benchtop light beams; this has enabled the use of small aperture cuvette cells and flat capillary tubes reducing substantially the amount of volume sample to be investigated. Methods, hints and tips, and golden rules tomeasure good quality, artifact-free SRCD and CD data will be described in this chapter in particular for the study of protein\u2013ligand interactions and protein photostability.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617637}
