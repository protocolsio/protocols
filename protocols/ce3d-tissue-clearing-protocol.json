Differences in refractive indices, or RI mismatch, cause the scattering of light in the tissue and result in tissue opacity. Tissue clearing reagents aim to reduce light scattering by normalizing the RI throughout the tissue, thus making the tissue transparent. Optical clearing is a valuable application that allows us gain a better understating of spatial composition, phenotypic and subtype identity, and cellular networks.
