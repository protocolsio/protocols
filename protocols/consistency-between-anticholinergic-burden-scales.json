The ACB scale identified the highest anticholinergic burden (26.8%) in prescriptions made the month before the fracture, and the highest agreement was between ACB and ADS (0.717); during hospitalization and at discharge, the cholinergic antagonists were best identified with ADS (77.7% and 72.1%, respectively), with the best agreement between ACB and ARS (0.613 and 0.568, respectively). The prescription of tramadol was found in 64.1% of hospitalized patients and in 61.4% of patients at the time of discharge.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Conclusions<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">: <\/span><span>the scales evaluated show marked discrepancies between them, with highly variable frequencies of anticholinergic drugs identified at the different prescription times, and with low agreement among them, which is why the scales are not interchangeable in patients with bone fractures.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1582646763}
