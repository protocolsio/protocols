Will the wound need to be stitched or otherwise sealed closed? Deep, fresh wounds with edges that can be easily apposed will typically fair better, and heal faster, with surgical intervention. Shallow wounds with unapposable edges, e.g. burns, will need to close over naturally. This is a much slower process and the wound must be kept moist and clean throughout. The wound itself should not be the only consideration when opting for a surgical or non-surgical approach. Healing by second intention inevitably involves regular handling to dress wounds, change bandages etc., and is always an important factor to consider when treating wild animals. Surgical closure will require a general anaesthetic which is not always ideal in a weak\/unstable bird.

Hydrocolloidal dressings, such as Granuflex encourage a moist environment to optimise healing. Granuflex and similar dressings (e.g. Allevyn Thin) will not adequately stick to the wound if creams or ointments are applied.

It is easy to apply VetWrap too tightly and thus it is helpful to unroll and then re-roll the VetWrap and Elastoplast tape prior to applying it on the bird to avoid the bandage being too tight.

In vultures, this can be seen as large swellings, typically on the underside of the foot, along with scaling\/cracking. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\nBumble-foot in vultures is almost always the result of a pressure sore initially affecting one foot. So, if one leg is damaged or painful, the bird takes excessive weight on the \u2018good foot\u2019. This excessive weight results in a pressure sore. Bacteria living naturally on the skin pass through the compromised skin, giving rise to a cellulitis (infection of the tissues between the skin and the bones of the foot). The foot swells, with the bird still standing on it, squeezing the blood supply out and preventing normal circulation, so the infection cannot be naturally controlled. As the foot is painful, birds often place too much weight on the opposite foot, resulting in bumble-foot in that foot also. \n<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The best way to treat bumble-foot is to prevent it altogether. Birds which have injured legs or hips and can only bear weight on one leg are at great risk of developing bumble-foot in the non-affected, weight-bearing leg. The risk of bumble-foot can be reduced by placing a corn plaster or doughnut shaped dressing on the (at risk) foot, relieving pressure on the ball. Vultures do not always tolerate dressings on their feet. In these cases, an alternative is to ensure the substrate of the enclosure is weight absorbing (e.g. course sand and rough bark on perches) to help reduce the risk. \n\n\n<\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","note":null,"link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054726,"guid":"2F4D4465C9784FDEAA8FB82196040DE8","order_id":3,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/b31954732c9b82dfb513bfbbdf079222fd5fc3461174c343b0232f6baf215cc5\/ckp8bafcf.png\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA9F6C","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1035443,"guid":"ECB51580FB9911EABCBBD929F5A2AB81","previous_id":1035441,"previous_guid":"8D9BFDC0FB9911EABCBBD929F5A2AB81","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"C5E762DBC2D34F959A4B1698170E866B","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Step-by-step guide to bumblefoot treatment"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"50528E0D87C34B179818ED6E4ECE2134","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Clean the area and scrub vigorously with disinfectant spray and a toothbrush or nail brush.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1035444,"guid":"ECC03910FB9911EABCBBD929F5A2AB81","previous_id":1035443,"previous_guid":"ECB51580FB9911EABCBBD929F5A2AB81","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"D0E9D18F32B643A797160460E2AFA743","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Step-by-step guide to bumblefoot treatment"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"E1D6BA028DB945768D3A0C5D11B49F0D","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Cover the surface of the infection with DMSO (Dexamethasone) ointment.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1035445,"guid":"ECCBAAC0FB9911EABCBBD929F5A2AB81","previous_id":1035444,"previous_guid":"ECC03910FB9911EABCBBD929F5A2AB81","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"BA581E3F0F6E486B8B3C052B2545CF51","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Step-by-step guide to bumblefoot treatment"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"06CC913627154C6C87DC3DD858E2B01F","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Prepare a doughnut-shaped cotton wool bandage (Fig. 9) to place around the bulge of the infection  (granuloma) to reduce the weight which is placed on the bulge directly.
