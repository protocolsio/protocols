Health experts across the globe agree, that the information gained from testing, is crucial in the management of the epidemiological curve, curbing the spread of the infection, reducing mortality, and optimal use and implementation of medical resources and staff.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">It is imperative to identify individuals with current infections, testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, to stop the human to human transmission, of the virus. To date, no country in the world has had the luxury of implementing blanket testing. Mainly because of the steep inclination of the epidemiological curve, whereby governmental and healthcare systems, cannot keep up with the rapid spread of the virus resulting in the exponential increase in symptomatic individuals requiring hospitalization and intensive care. Further challenges include logistical issues, in the distribution of testing kits to existing laboratories, setting up new facilities for sampling and testing, as demand increases. Lastly, third world countries have the added constraints of under-resourced healthcare systems and financial limitations to purchase enough molecular testing equipment.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Even if blanket testing were possible, diagnosing the SARS-COV-2 infected individual accurately remains a challenge.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This challenge exists for the following reasons: properties unique to the SARS-COV-2 virus (incubation period, a large portion of asymptomatic infected individuals spreading virus), the sensitivity of the RT-PCR ASSAY laboratory tests (depend on which combination of target genes are included in the various test kits, viral load present at the time of sampling, and availability of kits).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">A positive RT-PCR ASSAY test confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acids (RNA), in a nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, or any bodily fluid or tissue. Generally the sensitivity (accuracy) of RT-PCR ASSAY for SARS-COV-2 is in the region of 80%, with high specificity.
