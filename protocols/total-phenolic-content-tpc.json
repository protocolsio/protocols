[10]2 ml Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) reagent was added to 2 ml of diluted extracts.After 3 min, 750 \u00b5L of sodium carbonate anhydrous solution (7.5%, w\/v) was added, and the mixture was adjusted to 10 ml with distilled water. After 2 h, the absorbance was recorded at 765 nm. Calibration curves were constructed with gallic acid as a standard at concentrations ranging from 0\u2013100 mg\/ml. ml. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1583473847}
