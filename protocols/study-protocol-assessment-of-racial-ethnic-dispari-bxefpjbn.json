Secondary outcomes relate to comprehensiveness of surgery, and include performance of preoperative staging tests, preoperative lab testing, and preoperative teaching of patients, as well as length of stay and additional clinical outcomes.

One manifestation of imbalances in access to care for surgical patients is delays in the receipt of elective surgery. For example, identifying populations that undergo a higher proportion of emergent operations for a condition that is typically treated in the elective setting may serve as a way to identify groups with limited access to care. Colectomy and other colorectal surgeries for malignancy provides an example of a surgical procedure where almost all patients are anticipated to undergo elective surgery - given its ubiquitous screening and slow natural progression - and late presentation of disease may therefore stem from limited access or delays in seeking care. The key research question for this study is whether race/ethnicity is associated with timeliness of surgical treatment for colorectal cancer.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":52391,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":1229918,"number":"1","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":1234337,"guid":"C53F50EA0DCB48D38226E3DA39A22D1B","previous_id":1234336,"previous_guid":"EBE1B732326743D0A8F5434227CE2191","section":"\u003cp\u003eStudy Design\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"601d\",\"text\":\"Retrospective cohort study using a a statewide clinical registry.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","data":null,"protocol_id":52391,"case_id":0,"critical_ids":"","duration":0,"original_id":1229919,"number":"2","cases":[],"critical":null},{"id":1234338,"guid":"7DB7B662EE3D445F8CBB5AA651444804","previous_id":1234337,"previous_guid":"C53F50EA0DCB48D38226E3DA39A22D1B","section":"\u003cp\u003eData Sources\u003c/p\u003e","section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"is_substep":false,"step":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"cvd92\",\"text\":\"Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) Clinical Registry: The MSQC maintains a clinical registry that collects patient demographics, perioperative processes, and 30-day outcomes for patients undergoing surgery in Michigan.
