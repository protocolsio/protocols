While indices such as muscle thickness are common, reports on the relationship between muscle echo intensity and physical function have increased in the last few years. In the absence of randomized controlled trials of sufficient quantity and quality, a comprehensive summary of these studies has yet to be reported.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Inclusion criteria:<\/span><span> The participants should be healthy participants who are over 65 years old. The concept will be the investigation of the relationship between muscle echo intensity using ultrasound imaging and physical function such as muscle strength or physical performance (e.g., a sit and stand test or 6 minutes walking test). For context, only observational studies should be included.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods: <\/span><span>MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Web of Science will be systematically searched using the keywords \u201cecho intensity,\u201d \u201cultrasound,\u201d and \u201cgeriatrics\u201duntil March 2021.
