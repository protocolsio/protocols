In multivariable regressions, the odds of having functional basic water services in Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia were 8.006 times more likely when the WASHCos knew their duties and accountabilities than when they did not know. The odds of having functional basic water services were 30% more likely when the detection of Total Coliform Count in CFU\/100 ml decreases.<\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusion: <\/span><span>Our findings from Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia emphasize the importance of water quality to be added to the definition of basic water services in the global development indicators.
