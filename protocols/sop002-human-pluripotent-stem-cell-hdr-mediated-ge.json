Simply put, the piggyBac transposon (e.g. our in-house pMV vector or Transposagen commercially available vectors) containing Puro positive and Thymidine kinase negative selection markers is included in a standard homology directed repair template to facilitate the selection of cells containing your desired edit. The selection cassette is then seamlessly removed using a piggyBac excision only transposase (e.g. pBX). To achieve this type of gene editing a CRISPR\/Cas9 + specific gRNA plasmid is transfected into your cells of interest along the piggyBac transposon containing your repair template (e.g. mutation you want to insert or correct) and selection cassette. After the Cas9 nuclease + gRNA generates a site-specific DNA cleavage, the piggyBac donor is used by the cell\u2019s host machinery for DNA repair by homologous recombination, which results in the incorporation of your specific edit into the host genome together with the selection cassette (Figure 1). You can now select your gene edited cells with puromycin so you don\u2019t have to screen hundreds of clones (like it occurs with other methods). Once you isolate gene edited stem cell clones that carry out your edit of interest you can remove the selection cassette by transfecting your cells with an excision-only piggyBac transposase (e.g. PBx). The removal of the cassette by pBX is not 100% efficient. It is likely some of your cells will still carry the cassette. To remove all traces of cells containing the cassette you can take advantage of the thymidine kinase negative selection marker. Add Ganciclovir to your cells post pBX transfection and recovery to kill any remaining cells that still carry the cassette. The complete and detailed protocol below leads to Footprint-Free precise genome editing of PSCs.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1629397226}
