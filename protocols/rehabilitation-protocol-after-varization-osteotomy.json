The occurrence of these deformities lead to alteration in the load distribution \/ \u201cweight\u201d at the knee joint level, internal compartment in the varus knee and external compartment in the valgus knee. This mechanical overload causes cartilage wear, which by definition corresponds to arthrosis associated with ruptured menisci. These tears are the most important and frequent factor in the pain experienced by the patient. The new bone position is maintained by placing fixation material in titanium or steel (usually titanium, allowing nuclear magnetic resonance), which will allow bone consolidation in the desired position.

Table 1 presents the results obtained in the evaluation of knee joint amplitudes. In the first evaluation performed, there was limitation of the amplitudes of the right knee in relation to the left, especially in flexion where the difference between the two limbs was 63\u00ba. The subject had some discrepancies in the left knee, however during the treatment the amplitudes of both knees evolved favorably, having reached full extension and only a 9\u00ba difference in right knee flexion, compared to the left.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\">Table 1 - Evaluation of joint amplitudes (1st and 2nd evaluation moment)<\/div><\/div><table border><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Evaluation moment  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Knee\n  Extension  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Knee\n  Flexion  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\"><\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\"><\/td><\/tr><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">     <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Right Knee  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Left Knee  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Right Knee  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Left Knee  <\/td><\/tr><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  1st moment  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  -7\u00ba  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  -1\u00ba  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  66\u00ba  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  128\u00ba  <\/td><\/tr><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  2nd moment  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  -1\u00ba  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  0\u00ba  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  125\u00ba  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  134\u00ba  <\/td><\/tr><\/table><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">Looking at table 2, we found that the values of pain on movement from the 1st moment to the 2nd were greatly reduced and that it was no longer present at the 2nd assessment moment.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\">Table 2 - Assessment of pain on movement (1st and 2nd assessment moment)<\/div><\/div><table border><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  assessment moment  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  Pain\n  with movement  <\/td><\/tr><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  1st moment  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  6\/10  <\/td><\/tr><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  2nd moment  <\/td><td rowspan = \"\" colspan = \"\" style =\"display : table-cell;\">  0\/10  <\/td><\/tr><\/table><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Discussion<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>The results obtained in this case study with a ten-week rehabilitation program of therapeutic exercises in the aquatic environment point to an improvement in joint amplitudes, strength increase, balance improvement, reduction of pain to movement and improvement The patient sees the clinical situation of his knee as its functionality, leisure and quality of life.
