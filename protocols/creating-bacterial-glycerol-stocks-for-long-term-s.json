Bacteria on LB agar plate can be stored at 4\u00b0C for a few weeks. However, if you want to store bacteria for a longer time, you will need to establish glycerol stocks. The addition of glycerol stabilizes the frozen bacteria, preventing damage to the cell membranes and keeping the cells alive. A glycerol stock of bacteria can be stored stably at -80\u00b0C for many years.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1588866680}
