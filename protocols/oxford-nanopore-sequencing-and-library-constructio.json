Laos, Malaysia and Indonesia). The humpback puffer has many interesting biological features, such as inactivity, tetrodotoxin production and body expansion. Here, we reported the first chromosome-level genome assembly of the humpback puffer. The genome size is 362 Mb with ~1.78 Mb contig N50 and ~15.8 Mb scaffold N50. Based on the genome, ~61.5Mb (18.11%) repeat sequences were identified, 19,925 genes were annotated, and 90.01% of these genes could be predicted with function. Finally, a phylogenetic tree of ten teleost fish species was constructed, which suggests that humpback puffer and <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. nigroviridis <\/span><span>shared a common ancestor at 18.1 MYA and diverged from <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">T. rubripes <\/span><span>at 45.8 MYA.
