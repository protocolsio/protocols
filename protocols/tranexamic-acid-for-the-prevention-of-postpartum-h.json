Blood loss often necessitates resuscitation with red-cell transfusion, exposing patients at risk of hemolytic, anaphylactoid and infectious complications. To this end, the administration of a uterotonic agent is recommended aiming to limit postpartum blood loss. Tranexamic acid is a synthetic competitive lysine receptor inhibitor, serving as an antifibrinolytic agent by inhibiting plasmin-fibrin interactions and fibrin matrix stabilization. Previous meta-analyses have provided inconclusive evidence regarding the clinical utility of tranexamic acid therapy prior to caesarean delivery due to methodological limitations of studies and lack of follow-up for thromboembolic events. The present meta-analysis aims to accumulate current literature knowledge in the field and provide an updated synthesis of evidence concerning the efficacy and safety of prophylactic tranexamic acid for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in women undergoing cesarean delivery.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1194580,"guid":"F0B76B21CA3211EB9B5FBD84BC0EF814","previous_id":1194579,"previous_guid":"F0B6F5F0CA3211EB9B5FBD84BC0EF814","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"459F24B53AA1446298791EB82E8E51EE","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D8BB7C53D6144DDDA09F331B4FBEF578","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Study design The meta-analysis will be conducted in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1194581,"guid":"F0B7B941CA3211EB9B5FBD84BC0EF814","previous_id":1194580,"previous_guid":"F0B76B21CA3211EB9B5FBD84BC0EF814","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"859275CBD5CE48E5B37A36C9C61E3ACF","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"420A24EEFD00494F9DD4C4A0B505539E","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Search strategy Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Clinicaltrials.gov will be systematically searched from inception.
