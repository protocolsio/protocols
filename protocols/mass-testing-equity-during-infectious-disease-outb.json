It has been shown that racialized and marginalized communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and improving equitable access to COVID-19 testing would be a vital step in reducing disease propagation (1). Mass testing is instrumental for surveillance, directly informing prevention and control of measures of infectious diseases (2\u20135). The goal of mass testing interventions is to reduce transmission rates through detection, leading to treatment (when available), isolation, or other control and prevention measures (6). Mass testing programs often act as a link to care and support programs, which should be provided equitably, based on risk of infection (7). There is also the potential that mass testing interventions can further health inequities by failing to incorporate proportionate universalism - action that is proportionate to needs and levels of disadvantage in a population - into their delivery (8,9). Understanding the way in which health inequities are taken into account (or fail to be taken into account) in the design of mass testing programs is central to this review, and is a central aim of the HoSPiCOVID research project (10).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":null,"changed_on":1595342079}
