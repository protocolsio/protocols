It has been shown that racialized and marginalized communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and improving equitable access to COVID-19 testing would be a vital step in reducing disease propagation (1). Mass testing is instrumental for surveillance, directly informing prevention and control of measures of infectious diseases (2\u20135). The goal of mass testing interventions is to reduce transmission rates through detection, leading to treatment (when available), isolation, or other control and prevention measures (6). Mass testing programs often act as a link to care and support programs, which should be provided equitably, based on risk of infection (7). There is also the potential that mass testing interventions can further health inequities by failing to incorporate proportionate universalism - action that is proportionate to needs and levels of disadvantage in a population - into their delivery (8,9). Understanding the way in which health inequities are taken into account (or fail to be taken into account) in the design of mass testing programs is central to this review, and is a central aim of the HoSPiCOVID research project (10).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":985699,"guid":"4FC8C8FC23E240399144221B3B53AC0D","previous_id":985698,"previous_guid":"363FCB48CC6D4783A3C98523C7F194FA","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"02E9D90E93DA44979BD14155A949CAFB","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Review objective"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"6A14D5BCF76C4EF4B440639E2A323490","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of this scoping review is to study how equity of access to testing is currently being incorporated into the design and implementation of mass COVID-19 testing interventions but also historically, how equity of access and implemetnation was considered with other infectious disease testing and screening programs.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":985700,"guid":"9ED1D56ABC7E43BB834C0CDFF24AAFE6","previous_id":985699,"previous_guid":"4FC8C8FC23E240399144221B3B53AC0D","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"BD1220ED840941BE897543E1503CF8CA","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Search Strategy"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"E31474C6EA4F4215BA56113F19DB68E6","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">We will conduct a rapid literature search of PubMed and Web of Science [v.5.35].
