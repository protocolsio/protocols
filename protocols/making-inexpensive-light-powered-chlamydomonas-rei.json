Do not perform a long spin (10-15 minutes) as it generates a hard cell pellet which takes a long time to resuspend in 2% sodium alginate. Discard the supernatant and collect the cell pellet. Maximum number of total cells harvested per 50 mL falcon tube is 395 X106 cells\/50 mL falcon tube and should not be exceeded (Best result is obtained when the harvested cell numbers are between 250 x 106 - 395 x106 cells\/ 50 mL falcon tube). Note: Harvesting 100 mL of dense Chlamydomonas culture having cell density of 21 x 106 cells\/mL should generate 200-300 beads of 4 - 4.5 mm in diameter. The culture volume to spin down for harvesting cells depends on the cell density and the number of beads desired. To a cell pellet volume of 1.25- 1.5 mL, add 4-5 mL of 2% sodium alginate using a P1000 micropipette to get a final volume of 6-7 mL algae cell pellet\u2010sodium alginate suspension. [Crude ratio: 2% well mixed-sodium alginate is added to the cell pellet in a 5:1 or 4:1 ratio depending on the total number of cells harvested]. Mix the algae cell pellet and sodium alginate gently to obtain a uniform mixture by gently swirling the falcon tubes for 5-10 minutes or till the entire cell pellet is completely resuspended without any visible cell clumps. Vortexing of the cell pellet tubes should be avoided during resuspension of cells in sodium alginate. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Add the algae\u2010sodium alginate mix drop wise steadily and quickly with uniform pipetting motion by using a P1000 micropipette into a beaker of pre-chilled 3% CaCl2 kept on ice. [Note: Bead sizes vary depending on pipetting techniques and type of micropipette or plastic transfer pipette used]. Air bubbles create problems when plastic transfer pipettes are used but they are suitable for use in K4-K12 classrooms. If pipetting is not smooth and regular and algae-sodium alginate mixture is not mixed by swirling in between pipetting, irregular shaped beads or beads with different cell numbers\/bead (light and dark green beads) will form. Avoid holding the micropipette pipette tip very close to the CaCl2 liquid surface to prevent clogging of the pipette tip by calcium alginate because of the instantaneous reaction of sodium alginate with CaCl2. (Notes: DO NOT DISTURB the CaCl2 beaker while you are adding the drops. Make sure that you do not have any air gap or bubbles in your pipette tip while you pipette the algae-sodium alginate mixture). While pipetting dropwise the algae-sodium alginate suspension in CaCl2 solution, the beaker of chilled CaCl2 should not be shaken and should be given a very gentle swirl in between one batch of pipetting. This swirling mixes the CaCl2 solution around the beads that have formed in the CaCl2 beaker to harden them. Pipetting can be resumed only when CaCl2 liquid surface is still after the swirling of the CaCl2 solution. As soon as the algae-sodium alginate mixture drops hit the chilled CaCl2 liquid surface, they solidify into tiny beads. Continue making beads until all the mixture is used. Keep the CaCl2 beaker containing the beads on ice for 10-15 minutes to allow complete solidification of the algal beads. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Separate the algal beads from the CaCl2 solution by filtering through a strainer\/coffee filter and collect the filtered CaCl2 in a bottle using a funnel. This filtered CaCl2 can be stored in a fridge at 4\u00baC and can be reused three- five times for making algal beads in future. Algal beads should be rinsed gently and thoroughly with tap water for at least five minutes to remove residual sodium chloride which is formed when sodium alginate reacts with calcium chloride to form calcium alginate and sodium chloride. This step is a very important step and must not be skipped as any residual sodium chloride will hinder photosynthesis in the experiment. Use a plastic spoon to scoop out the beads gently from the strainer to put them in a petri dish containing small amount of tap water to prevent drying of beads while you make the bracelets\/necklaces (see below). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Note: Any leftover algae beads can be stored in tap water in the refrigerator for 2-3 days for future experiments.

Cut off caps of 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with a scissor. Use de-capped Eppendorf tubes to plug the ends of the bracelet tubing (one de-capped tube at each end of the cut tubing).  Cut colorful yarns according to wrist width, intertwine them to make braids. Loop one braid tightly onto the mouth of each de-capped Eppendorf tube at each end of the bracelet. Cut plastic transfer pipette tip ends at an angle to form scoops. Next, unplug one end of the bracelet tubing by removing one of the de-capped Eppendorf tube that you used for sealing the tubing end. Add about 3-5 mL of tap water [pH 6.9 -7] (depending on the length of the bracelet tubing ranging from 5 inches to 7 inches) into the bracelet flexible tubing either using a micropipette or a plastic transfer pipette. De-ionized\/E-pure water is known to contain less dissolved gases and minerals than tap water. Amounts of dissolved oxygen and carbon-dioxide in the water used for photosynthesis monitoring experiment will affect the results in a photosynthesis lab. We have found that tap water works best for the photosynthesis experiment.  It is important to have about 0.5 cm-1 cm air gap at each end inside the tubing to provide enough air for cells to breathe as the cells are oxygen-stressed inside the beads. To prepare 10 algae bead bracelets, each 5 inches long and containing 10-12 beads, you would need to make approximately 100-120 beads. Always make extra beads and store them for future use for 2-5 days in the fridge. Add 8-9 drops of the bicarbonate indicator solution to 3.5 ml- 4 mL of tap water inside the bracelets. For algae bead necklaces each of 6-7 inches long, you will need 20-35 beads per necklace. Add 10-11 drops of the pH indicator bicarbonate indicator solution to 4.5 ml- 5.5 mL of tap water inside the algal bead necklaces. Algae beads should be scooped from the petri dish using the transfer pipettes which have been converted to a scoop. Gently introduce the algal beads using the scoop into the tap water inside the tubing without squeezing the bulb of the transfer pipette and just let the water flow inside the tubing get the beads from the immersed scoop. Plug the end of the tubing back with the de-capped Eppendorf tube. Give a gentle swish to the tubing to mix the water and the bicarbonate indicator solution inside the tubing. Check the sealing at the tubing ends to ensure the tubing ends were sealed tightly and there is no water leakage. Plugging must be tight but not so tight so that it makes it hard for you to take out the Eppendorf tubes to flush the bracelet tubing and reuse it in future. Hence do not push the Eppendorf tubes all the way into the tubing.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":945714,"guid":"372150B19AC011EAB35DF1B968737D49","previous_id":945713,"previous_guid":"3720B4709AC011EAB35DF1B968737D49","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"47F0F41CF1C44D73AA1114CAEED69045","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F47A71348E79412A9815BB25FA1F02CE","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Dark and light exposures of algae bead bracelets\/necklaces:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Image the bracelet and record the pH of the water before shifting it to light.

But to our experience, the bracelet takes longer time to change color when kept under one LED indoor plant grow light because the light intensity is not high enough compared to what one gets with cool white fluorescent lights. You might need 2-3 indoor plant grow light to speed up the color change in the bracelets (we have not tried it). After light exposure for 2-4 hours (depending on the length of the bracelet tubing and number of algae beads inside the tubing), the bracelet will change from light red\/magenta to a dark blue\/purple color via gradient color changes because of an increase in pH induced by photosynthesis in light. When shifted to dark for 3-4 hours the bracelet color will change from dark blue\/purple to bright yellow via gradient color changes because of a decrease in pH induced by cellular respiration and absence of photosynthesis. You can switch the bracelet back forth between light and dark for 2-3 times over a period of 2-3 days and it should show color changes.
