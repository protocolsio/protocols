After the perfusion, the stomach was removed from the visceral cavity and trimmed to include the distal lower esophageal sphincter and the proximal pylorus. The entire stomach was then opened with a longitudinal cut along the lesser and greater curvature into two equal halves (dorsal and ventral parts) and any food or residue in the stomach was removed by rinsing thoroughly with DI H2O.
