Similar to Open Access Week, the purpose of LDW events is to raise awareness and build a community to engage on topics related to research data management, sharing, preservation, reuse, and library-based research data services. We share practical tips, resources, and stories to help researchers at any stage in their career use good data practices. We believe research data are the foundation of the scholarly record and crucial for advancing our knowledge of the world around us.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">CMU Libraries is proud to offer an institutional license to protocols.io, a collaborative platform for computational workflows, operational procedures, instructions\/manuals, and more! It can even be used for cooking recipes! To highlight the research workflow capabilities of protocols.io, we are proud to offer several dessert recipes that are tried-and-true by our 2020 Love Data Week committee at CMU Libraries. Why not make them for a special someone this Valentine's Day?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We hope you enjoy, and feel free to contact us at UL-DataServices@andrew.cmu.edu if you'd like to use this platform for your research data needs!<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1581268367}
