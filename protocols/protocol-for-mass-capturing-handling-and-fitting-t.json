These protocols were employed with four species of southern African vultures: Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres), African White-backed vulture (Gyps africanus), Lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos), and Hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus), but may be applied with other similar species. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1600369049}
