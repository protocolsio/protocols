Functionalization of polymers can provide improved stability, solubility, trafficking pathways, and therapeutic potential for already useful biomolecules in a variety of applications. For instance, synthetically modified polymers can act as a tracker to record changes in cell behavior, as a marker for bio-imaging, or as a carrier to deliver drugs to targeted cells. Apart from that, polymers can also reveal enzyme function and determine protein biodistribution in the biomedical field after linking specific
