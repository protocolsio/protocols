With the recent development of these technologies, we now have the ability to get whole genomes of information in mere hours. There are numerous NGS technologies, such as Illumina, Roche 454, and Ion Torrent Sequencing. However, the NGS tech that you will learn how to operate is nanopore sequencing.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Nanopore sequencing utilizes electrophoresis to pull nucleic acids through a protein pore. As a strand of DNA is pulled through a nanopore by an imposed electrical field, the DNA base sequence generates a sequence-dependent change in ionic current. The magnitude of the ionic current depends on the diameter of the pore being used to sequence, the concentration of<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">electrolytes surrounding the pore, and the DNA or RNA that is occupying the pore. The sample is passed through the pore will cause characteristic changes to this current, which can then be interpreted to give us the genetic sequence of our sample.<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/20d4dd5e38e2f1ef45900cd045c9696c2a68f968208b51f33837428dbb33777e\/ckdkbe7nx.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>As mentioned earlier, the nanopore utilizes a protein pore in order to pass a strand of DNA through a membrane. There have been different types of pores that scientists have tested for optimal efficiency and accuracy of sequencing. The structure of later generation pores has even been modified by<\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\"> site-directed mutagenesis in an effort to optimize sequencing accuracy. An early protein pore was <\/span><span>alpha-hemolysin<\/span><span style = \":UNDERLINE;\"> (aHL).<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This transmembrane pore resembles a hollowed-out mushroom and has a \"large\" vestibule<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">opening at the top and 3 sites that contribute to discrimination between each base<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>sequenced. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MspA_porin\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A<\/span><\/a><span> (MspA) is a second-generation protein pore that\u2019s been studied and has been presumed to be a more advantageous pore as compared to aHL because of it\u2019s improved sequencing accuracy. The natural version of this protein needed to be altered because it contained a core of 3 negatively charged aspartic acids so they changed these to 3 neutrally charged asparagines. This mutated version of MspA has increased the specificity of identifying bases tenfold. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">There are also pores that don\u2019t rely on a protein\u2019s properties but that of a metal or metal alloy substrate to generate a solid-state nanopore (substrate with a nanometer-sized hole) for DNA or RNA translocation and base detection. These Solid State nanopores sense base sequences using different methods. One approach for base detection involves tunneling current which is the phenomenon where electrons are forced past a barrier they typically wouldn\u2019t be able to pass through. As bases pass through the pore, the tunneling current detector (in the form of a scanning probe microscope) is used to sense individual bases in a nucleic acid strand and provide sequence information.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Did you know?<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/20d4dd5e38e2f1ef45900cd045c9696c2a68f968208b51f33837428dbb33777e\/ckdgbe7nx.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The Concept for nanopore sequencing was first conceptualized right here at UCSC! In the early 1990s, UCSC professor David Deamer, Harvard professor Daniel Branton, and Mark Akeson pioneered the early concepts of nanopore sequencing, using an aHL (alpha-hemolysin)  pore. Currently, the nanopore group at UCSC, led by Professor Mark Akeson, in collaboration with the company Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and the National Institutes of Health to expand the capabilities of nanopore sequencing.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":UNDERLINE;font-weight:bold;\">Key Things to know<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">MinION: <\/span><span>The MinION is a small, relatively cheap($1,000) sequencer developed by the company Oxford Nanopore Technologies.
