class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Background<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   Excessive alcohol consumption is a social problem. According to the World Health Organization, approximately three million deaths were attributed to alcohol consumption, which is 5.3% of all deaths. Despite this high mortality, only a small number of alcoholics receive alcoholism treatment, and many do not receive it. The reason for the lack of progress in the treatment of alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorders (AUD) has been that the goal of sobriety is a hurdle for alcoholics. Abstinence is a common therapeutic goal, but the perception that abstinence is the only treatment goal may discourage treatment-seeking. Recently, it was reported that the prognosis at one year was the same for both abstinence and moderation use goals in the treatment of alcohol dependence and that it was important for patients to choose their own treatment goal of abstinence or reduction in alcohol consumption to continue treatment. Therefore, medication to reduce drinking is used for patients whose treatment goal is to reduce drinking. In the past, a network meta-analysis (NMA) of pharmacologically controlled drinking in the treatment of alcoholism or AUD has been reported. The review summarizes existing data from randomized controlled trials up to June 2016. However, in recent years, there have been several reports that there are some drugs that can be expected to reduce alcohol consumption including anticonvulsants, and some RCTs of drugs to reduce alcohol consumption have been reported. This systematic review and NMA aimed to summarize and critically appraise all existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of drug therapy for reducing alcohol consumption in the treatment of alcohol dependence or AUD.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Purpose<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    The purpose of this study is to conduct an updated review of efficacy and safety of drug therapy aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in the treatment of alcohol dependence or AUD.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Method and analysis<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">[Part 1]<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Updated review of drug therapy aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in the treatment of alcohol dependence or AUD (clinical definition)<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of our review is to update efficacy and safety of drug therapy aimed at reducing alcohol consumption in the treatment of alcohol dependence or AUD.
