The advantages of the Pair Test are 1) a balanced paradigm allowing comparison between verbal and non-verbal memory, 2) assessment of learning, delayed recall and recognition using one tool, 3) paired-associate learning tool to assess cognitive processes that are dependent on the hippocampal network, and 4) the use of a tablet-based application allowing controlled administration process and engaging approach to neuropsychological testing. The test provides behavioural evidence of the integrity of the hippocampi and its interaction with the neocortical learning system.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Buck et al., (2020).
