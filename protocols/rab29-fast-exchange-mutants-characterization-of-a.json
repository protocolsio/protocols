Its fast nucleotide exchange rate and inability to bind GDI in cytosol make it a unique and poorly understood Rab. Because the conventional, \u201cGTP-locked\u201d Rab mutation does not have the desired effect in Rab29, we present here the use of a fluorescence-based assay to characterize novel mutants that display faster nucleotide exchange rates, allowing for GEF-independent Rab29 activation. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1587581601}
