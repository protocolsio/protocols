For water quality analysis, polyethylene bottles were filled with no less than 1000 mL of water per sample. For surface water, the pH was measured using a pH meter (FE20; METTLER TOLEDO, Zurich, Switzerland). Suspended solid (SS) was analyzed by the gravimetric method (GB 11901-89, 1990). The nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) was determined using a turbidity meter (2100Q; HACA, Loveland, USA). Total iron (Fe) was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICAP6300; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Samples collected at the same point were mixed equably and concentrated randomly to give 10\u201320 mL per sample, followed by filtration with 25 # plankton filter and storage in sealed glass bottles with 1 mL of formol . Qualitative and quantitative analyses of plankton communities were performed using an optical microscope (SAGA SG-300; Suzhou Shenying Optical Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China). The morphology of plankton was observed and identified at the genus level according to previous study; then individuals for each genuswas recorded (Siet al, 2019). The diversity of plankton was estimated using Shannon's diversity index.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Only herbs were collected from the salt marsh area without shrubs, trees, or other tall plants. Considering the extremely low density and uneven distribution of plants, the salt marsh area was divided into four units in the east, west, north, and south directions, respectively. Multi-point random sampling was conducted based on field survey to record the number of plant species, plant height, and coverage area. Photographs were taken to identify plants at the genus level with reference to the map.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1097940,"guid":"A1460F7049DF11EB808FF124B9515688","previous_id":1097929,"previous_guid":"A956AF9049DE11EB808FF124B9515688","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"5B32949A339E4FCC9AB07A4A9DDFC987","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"93522430B52B4A8FB7C85E650FCA2BEB","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Assessment methods<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1097942,"guid":"EB0B67E049DF11EB808FF124B9515688","previous_id":1097940,"previous_guid":"A1460F7049DF11EB808FF124B9515688","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"41D2C34A71834BDB8FEB8057562236EA","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"methods"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F6F1440D590A45D4AFCC57EBEA3F1084","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;\">Establishment and weight assignment of the assessment indicator system<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The AHP was used to assess the ecological status of water resources in the salt marsh area.
