Shocks or disturbances of the health system are the results of a number of various drivers or causal factors that do not necessarily mean just stresses and extreme system issues caused by external events. However, the possibility that shocks and disturbances are a result of intentional actions taken by actors in international, national or local spheres is still widely overlooked in the resilience literature. For example, reforms of modes of governance, funding structures or delivery of care are all types of health system disturbances or shocks that can have both expected and unintended effects. Building a resilient health system is a non-linear process that requires evaluation of the system's strengths and limitations, as well as historical learning to comprehend how the health system has evolved. In other words, we can learn about the resilience of current health systems by looking at past disturbances or shocks triggered by stressors (such as reforms).<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Inclusion criteria:<\/span><span> Peer-reviewed articles, literature reviews, book chapters, grey literature, reports were included in the review if they have been published between 1991 and 2021, and published in English or in French. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods:<\/span><span> The search strategy will aim to locate both academic and grey literature.
