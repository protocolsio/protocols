A nitrocellulose membrane is treated with streptavidin in a test line. Biotin and Fluorescein FITC are tagged to different RdRP primers mixed in isothermal RNA amplification (LAMP) assay. In the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP viral gene the primers bind to the target RNA and make copies of the gene fragment (amplicon) in a highly specific manner.  After icubation and application to the lateral flow sample well monoclonal antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold bind to FITC tagged amplicons.  Only those amplicons with both biotin and FITC adhere to the lateral flow Test line is conjugated to colloidal gold nanoparticles. The colloidal gold containing antibodies accumulate on Test line area until a visible signal is produced and may be quantified using imaging. A control antibody binding site on the membrane indicates the test conditions are favorable.  A second control reaction directed against human RNase P is included as a control to assure the LAMP amplifiction conditions were adequate.   The presence of the second test line is expected.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This test detects SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) captured on a swab, aspirate or dispersed in transport medium. The NPS are mixed with a lysis buffer. When this mixture comes into contact with the strip, the conjugate migrates with the sample by passive diffusion and the conjugate and sample material come into contact with the streptavidin on the strip membrane and FITC antibody. If the sample contains tagged SARS-CoV-2 RdRP, the anti-FITC colloidal gold conjugate antibody will be bound to the FITC tagged amplicon.  The result is detected by COVIDscanDX mScanner within 25 minutes and positive results may be visible as early as 10 minutes in the form of a pink line (Positive Test Line) that develops on the strip. The solution continues to migrate to encounter a control reagent that binds a control conjugate, thereby producing a second pink line (Control Line). If SARS-CoV-2 virus is absent from the sample or at concentrations below the limit of detection, only two pink lines will be detected at 25 minutes (Control Line). Although the COVIDscanDX LAMP-LFD test may be read visually, it is intended to be used with the COVIDScanDx template card and a mobile device for optimal sensitivity.
