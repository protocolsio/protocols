Since there is no system of cost unit analysis in our hospital, the hospital charge was used to represent direct hospital cost (the hospital charge multiplied by cost-to-charge ratio) [8, 9]. Subsequently, a fixed cost-to-charge ratio eventually cancelled out when the hospital cost in PRE was divided by the hospital cost in non-PRE. Since we focused on direct hospital cost in pediatric ambulatory surgery, the indirect costs (the combination of transportation cost and parental loss of income) were omitted in the analysis.

The PRE group was defined as children who had perioperative respiratory events such as laryngospasm, bronchospasm, upper airway obstruction [10], or reintubation either intraoperatively or in the PACU period with or without having desaturation. Desaturation was defined as oxygen saturation (SpO2) by pulse oxymetry that was <95% for more than 10 seconds [11]. The occurrence of PRE, causes of PRE, and the lowest SpO2 intraoperatively or at PACU were recorded immediately in the vital signs table and in the data record form by the anesthetist nurse in charge of each operating theater. The patients with PRE and the lowest recorded SpO2 were placed into 3 categories based on the occurrence\/severity of perioperative desaturation (PD): no PD (SpO2 >94%), mild to moderate PD (SpO2 86\u201394%), and severe PD (SpO2 <86%). Patients in the non-PRE group were defined as children who did not develop any PRE intraoperatively or in the PACU period based on the recorded data form. Occurrence\/severity of PRE was divided into 3 categories: non-PRE, mild to moderate PRE (SpO2 86\u201399%) and severe PRE (SpO2 <86%). Time to first PRE event and duration of PRE were also recorded to increase the accuracy of the main exposure.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Outcomes of interest  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Prolonged hospitalization post-surgery  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The primary outcome was length of stay post-surgery. Any hospital stay recorded by the PACU nurses followed approval by both the surgeon and anesthesiologist in charge. The number of days of hospitalization post-surgery as well as occurrence of postoperative complications were obtained from the hospital information system by the principal investigator (MO). In our hospital, 25% of ambulatory surgery cases are planned admissions, usually occurring from surgical concerns or parent's preference (insurance\/difficult transportation[EM1] [A2] ). An unplanned admission could arise from an anesthetic adverse event or surgical complication. Based on past data, the average length of stay for a planned admission is 1.0 day. [EM3] [A4] Therefore, prolonged length of stay post-surgery was defined as the number of hospitalization days more than 1 day for a planned admission and at least 1 day for an unplanned admission post-surgery. The duration of PACU stay and postoperative oxygenation were recorded by the PACU nurses.  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Excess hospital cost  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The secondary outcome was excess hospital cost. Hospital charge was used instead of direct hospital cost for a comparison between PRE and non-PRE. Thus, excess hospital charge was defined as all hospital charges excluding the surgical charge in the PRE group minus those in the non-PRE groups. Hospital charges included the use of resources within the health sector, e.g. home medication, anesthesia charge, and hospitalization [12]. After the patient was discharged, total hospital charges were obtained from the hospital information system and recorded by the principal investigator (MO).   <\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1160966,"guid":"888E74D09C5611EBABE6512812B91600","previous_id":1160965,"previous_guid":"888BDCC09C5611EBABE6512812B91600","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"EB58F265B2C94E7585BCA88DFC0BD633","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Objective and methodology"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"23545FCA032F4B068344F899AEF8CA17","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Financial information<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">  In the area of hospital planning, financial information including net revenue, direct hospital costs, fixed costs, and variable costs need to be addressed. Gross revenue arises from the hospital charges of each outpatient, or inpatient if admitted. We used a cost-to-charge ratio of 0.4 based on our previous estimate of direct hospital costs [7], therefore, direct hospital costs were calculated from hospital charges multiplied by 0.4. Since fixed expenditures associated with buildings, salaries, equipment and other overhead were not obtained from our previous study [7], fixed cost was omitted in the present study. Thus, the variable costs included medication and supplies, which change based on the number and acuity [EM5] [A6] of patients treated would be obtained in our financial information [13]. [EM7] [A8] Therefore, direct hospital cost, e.g. accommodation, meals, medication, laboratory, and nursing care service, would represent the variable cost in our setting. Since contribution margin represents actual net cash \ufb02ows for individual patients in terms of delivery of care [14], the contribution margin instead of total margin was calculated in this study. The contribution margin was obtained from gross revenue (hospital charges) minus variable costs (direct hospital cost). \u00a0Therefore, the contribution margin in our setting was calculated from hospital charges multiplied by 0.6<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Potential confounding variables  <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Patient-related characteristics and type of payment system were obtained at the preoperative period by the investigative team (BS, BS, KN) while surgical and anesthesia-related variables were obtained at the intraoperative period by the anesthetist nurse in charge of each operating theater.
