It utilises a membrane-bound stain and requires a high-content imaging system such as a PerkinElmer Oprea Phenix or similar and downstream image analysis pipelines. The suggested dye labels live cells, fluoresces in far red, and shows no evidence of toxicity in hPSCs. This protocol is useful in situations where cell quantification by manual or automated counting becomes rate-limiting, such as when multiple lines are grown for high-throughput differentiation experiments on different genetic backgrounds, or for survival or morphology-based screens in systems where cells have clearly defined cell borders.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1607349212}
