However if that is not needed, then separating the head\/pronotum from the abdomen with forceps will work well.\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Long incubation times (12-20hrs) really seems to be the key. Do them overnight, that is set-up the incubation in the afternoon and then finish them the next morning.\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">As much light vortexing as you can reasonably get in helps too (Speed around 250 - just a bit to make the solution to move). We usually try to get a few vortexs in before leaving for the day and then a few the next day.\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Per usual with non-destructive extractions, after incubation I rinse the beetle in the EtOH and then air dry it if you are going to re-pin them.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Lastly, always elute in a small volume, < 50ul, with old specimens will even perform a second elution with the first elute ( 2 elutions of 50 ul). Add same 50 ul again to the column 15 minutes to sit before centrifuge and then centrifuge again.<\/div><\/div>","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The purpose of this protocol is to extract DNA from pinned beetles.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol is part of the Bark Beetle Mycobiome (BBM) Research Coordination Network.
