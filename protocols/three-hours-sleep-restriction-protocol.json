Participants were randomized to undergo both conditions in a counterbalanced order with an interval of approximately 1 month, and completed several questionnaires such as the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire (KSQ) sleep quality index and snoring symptom index, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS).  Among the questionnaires, the PANAS score was recorded in  both conditions of sleep restriction and normal sleep.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1607059328}
