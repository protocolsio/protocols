class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Arsenic is so toxic to insects, bacteria, and mushrooms that it is used as a preservative in wood. For example, copper and arsenic chromate (CCA), a common preservative in wood preservative treatment, has been the largest consumer of arsenic since the 1950s. But in recent years, with the countries all over the world for the continuous improvement of environmental protection and health requirements, the United States, Japan, the European Union and other countries and regions have banned or restricted use of CCA wood preservatives and CCA processing wood, those who replace is ACQ (tetravalent cuprammonium complex) and CBA (pyrrole boron copper complex) type does not contain arsenic green building materials such as wood preservative, thus arsenic are plunged in the field of wood processing.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">At present, arsenic is mainly used as alloy material in copper and lead alloys. In addition, arsenic is also used as a doped material in some semiconductor materials, such as N-type semiconductor materials. As people's health and environmental awareness increases, the use of arsenic in pesticides, herbicides, wood preservatives, pesticides and other aspects is gradually decreasing. Arsenic is also used as an alloy because of its semi-metallic nature. For example, arsenic-lead alloys containing 2 percent arsenic are used in the military industry to make bullets, military poisons, and fireworks. Arsenic-copper alloy made by adding 0.15%-0.5% arsenic to copper can significantly reduce the thermal and electrical conductivity of copper, improve the processing plasticity of oxygen-containing copper, and is often used in the production of supporting screw rods in train combustor and parts in high temperature reduction atmosphere<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1600649265}
