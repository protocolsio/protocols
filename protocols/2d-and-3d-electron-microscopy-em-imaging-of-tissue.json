Carbon is preferred for FIB-SEM due to its amorphous nature, minimizing ion milling artifacts (i.e., curtaining) that distort final image quality. However, metal coatings (i.e. irridium, gold, platinum, etc.) can be used if carbon is not available. Suggested coating thicknesses are 8-nm for carbon or 4-nm for metal. The ideal thickness will provide adequate charge mitigation under the electron beam, but will not be so thick that it is obviously visible in images. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>A Leica ACE600 High Vacuum Sputter Coater fitted with a rotating platform is used in the OHSU laboratory.The coating thickness is monitored and measured with an <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">in situ <\/span><span>quartz crystal localized in the center of the rotating platform.<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":954898,"guid":"4D5D0410A5FA11EA80BE5B516D7328D1","previous_id":955227,"previous_guid":"43B7E730A67D11EA80BE5B516D7328D1","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"080549D59DDA4A6388AF6560343AC93F","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Sample stub preparation for large format mapping and 3DEM"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"82052DD37C8D43718A3F9C08EDCBEDA6","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Blocks rough trimmed from the empty resin are <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">mounted <\/span><span>on Microtome stub SEM pins (Agar Scientific, cat# 61092450) or Aluminum Mini Pin SEM pins (Ted Pella, cat# 16180) using conductive silver epoxy (Ted Pella, Inc., H2OE EPO-TEK\u00ae cat# 16014).

Analyses of these images increase our understanding of cellular organization and interactions and disease-related changes therein. Here, we describe a workflow and generalized conditions for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging, including optical using Toluidine-Blue stained sections, large-format high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) montages, and 3D focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) image stacks, that allow pathologists and cancer biology researchers to identify areas of interest from human cancer biopsies.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Note: Imaging conditions described here may differ somewhat depending on microscope manufacturer.
