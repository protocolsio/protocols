Photosynthetic pico and nanoeukaryotes populations selected based on light scatter, orange phycoerythrin and red chlorophyll fluorescence are sorted in sterile eppendorf tubes containing Tris-EDTA lysis buffer (Tris 10 mM, EDTA 1 mM and Triton x-100 1.2%).The Tris, EDTA and water use should be molecular grade. A buffer containing Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8.0 and NaCl 20 mM and filtered at 0.22 \u03bcm should be used as sheath liquid for marine samples. Sheath fluid samples should be collected and analyzed as negative controls in all subsequent steps including sequencing, in order to test for contamination in the flow sorting process. After the sorting, samples can be stored at -80C. The DNA from sorted cells can be extracted by three cycles of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in water.<\/div><br\/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"297C14839F09442A83079F1841F71636","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/dztug6iw.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1032951,"guid":"53388F10F82711EAA56D99CA94AB5FB7","previous_id":1017239,"previous_guid":"891602C0EB7A11EA9DE20175FB8CA26B","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"ECDDB81409924D4380967202139D7B50","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Preparation of libraries for Illumina sequencing (metabarcoding)"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"EEEDD68FDC6848689A632FD2989F09CA","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">If the PCR\u2019s product are not concentrated enough, you could purify and concentrate them in a smaller volume using a purification and concentration kit like \u201cNuclesopin Gel & Clean up kit\u2013 Macherey-Nagel\u201d.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">Once PCR products are correct, they are pooled and organized in appropriated PCR plates to generate libraries.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">If the illumina sequencing is realized on the Genomer Platform<\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;font-weight:bold;\"> <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">in Roscoff (France), see the protocols.io \"Preparation of libraries for Illumina sequencing - Genomer Platform\".<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">If the sequencing is realized by another sequencing service,<\/span><span> send to the service pictures of gel to check they are conform (purity, degradation, bands intensity, etc) and follow its protocol.<\/span><\/div><br\/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">For metabarcoding purpose, the first step involves the amplification by PCR of a given gene region (for example V4 or V9 region of 18S rRNA gene) or gene itself if its size does not exceed 600bp (the longest fragment size that can be sequenced by Illumina technology). <\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">The defined forward and reverse primers that are complementary upstream and downstream of the region of interest, needs to be designed with overhang adapters which will be used in a subsequent limited\u2010cycle amplification step, in order to add the dual\u2010index barcodes and Illumina flow cell adapters.
