PHA-activated T cells, or PHA blasts, can be used for downstream applications such as transduction (e.g. of a CAR or TCR) or as target cells for CTLs since they express sufficiently high levels of HLA class I. An especially useful application is for QCing a batch of frozen PBMCs -- if PHA blasts do not grow in 5 days from a given batch, then it is unlikely that such cells are in adequate condition for more sensitive in vitro applications. I describe here how I like to make them.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1604820882}
