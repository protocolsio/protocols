Multi-drug resistant (MDR) and totally-drug resistant (TDR) isolates have also now evolved. Of increasing importance in many countries are the Non-Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM), mycobacterial species which are common soil and water contaminants. Many NTM are able to cause chronic lung and skin and soft tissue infections, especially in patients with suppressed immune systems. One example are members of the <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Mycobacterium abscessus<\/span><span> complex. <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">M. abscessus<\/span><span> infections are difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance and new compounds that target this group are much needed.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Because of the slow growth of many mycobacterial species, we routinely use luciferase-tagged strains (1) for our assays.
