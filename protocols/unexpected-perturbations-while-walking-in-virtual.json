An example for perturbation type by criteria would be: (1) platform left in (2) initial contact (3) right =a displacement of the platform to the left was executed when initial contact phase was detected for the right foot. Medio-lateral platform perturbations were achieved by displacing the moving platform 15 cm, to the left or to the right, over 0.92 seconds (perturbation level 12, see Fig. 4). The platform held its new position for 30 seconds, to allow full recovery of the gait parameters (i.e., step length and step width), and then returned gradually to its original position over 3 seconds; (2) anterior-posterior treadmill belt perturbations were achieved by reducing the speed of one of the treadmill belts by 1.2 m\/s with a deceleration of 5 m\/s<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>(perturbation level 12, see Fig. 4). To enable anterior-posterior perturbations, the treadmill speed was fixed to the measured average self-paced walking speed 5 seconds prior to perturbation onset.

Force plate data was filtered using a low-pass filter with cutoff frequency of 5Hz and a force threshold of 25N is used; no filters were applied to the marker data. Initial contact was detected when the vertical force from the foot in front (leading limb) exceeded a minimum for of 35N (minimum force was chosen to avoid force plate baseline noise); mid-stance was detected 200ms after initial contact; and toe off was detected when the vertical force from the force plate on the side of the trailing limb went under the minimum force. Once the relevant gait phase was detected the main system computer gave a command to the platform or the treadmill belt to execute the perturbation. Since there was a lag time between the detection of the relevant gait phase and perturbation execution, we re-evaluated the actual perturbation type post-hoc. Gait phases and leading limb were defined using the heel markers\u2019 position in the sagittal plane [4]. Initial contact and toe off were detected when the heel marker was at its maximal forward or backward position, respectively, with 0.025 seconds margins. Perturbation that was introduced beyond this margins was considered a mid-stance perturbation. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Perturbation magnitude and timing (see experimental procedure below) were controlled and modified by the VR system computer.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/protocols-files.s3.amazonaws.com\/private\/45c04beb4f6177c66ee402e1d58b842238e8be62e88765bb11d96b1f38a837de\/b2ssbb357.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYFAX46LHRVQMGOA%2F20200604%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200604T200101Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-Signature=59371ab43ccf94d821ebb3c9cebacd2918b65061a157609ed1b03b6c6cbf84ad\" \/><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054727,"guid":"C76F2790B6C74344B8A261D4C0FB32BC","order_id":4,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Capturing gait parameters<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Gait speed was obtained from an encoder on the drive shaft of the treadmill motor.

An example for perturbation type by criteria would be: (1) platform left in (2) initial contact (3) right =a displacement of the platform to the left was executed when initial contact phase was detected for the right foot. Medio-lateral platform perturbations were achieved by displacing the moving platform 15 cm, to the left or to the right, over 0.92 seconds (perturbation level 12, see Fig. 4). The platform held its new position for 30 seconds, to allow full recovery of the gait parameters (i.e., step length and step width), and then returned gradually to its original position over 3 seconds; (2) anterior-posterior treadmill belt perturbations were achieved by reducing the speed of one of the treadmill belts by 1.2 m\/s with a deceleration of 5 m\/s<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">2<\/span><span>(perturbation level 12, see Fig. 4). To enable anterior-posterior perturbations, the treadmill speed was fixed to the measured average self-paced walking speed 5 seconds prior to perturbation onset. The perturbation was presented when the relevant gait phase was detected, and 3 seconds later the treadmill was once again set to self-paced mode (see perturbation profiles, Fig 4). <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Relevant gait phase was detected using force plate data and toe marker data in the sagittal plane. Force plate data was filtered using a low-pass filter with cutoff frequency of 5Hz and a force threshold of 25N is used; no filters were applied to the marker data. Initial contact was detected when the vertical force from the foot in front (leading limb) exceeded a minimum for of 35N (minimum force was chosen to avoid force plate baseline noise); mid-stance was detected 200ms after initial contact; and toe off was detected when the vertical force from the force plate on the side of the trailing limb went under the minimum force. Once the relevant gait phase was detected the main system computer gave a command to the platform or the treadmill belt to execute the perturbation. Since there was a lag time between the detection of the relevant gait phase and perturbation execution, we re-evaluated the actual perturbation type post-hoc. Gait phases and leading limb were defined using the heel markers\u2019 position in the sagittal plane [4]. Initial contact and toe off were detected when the heel marker was at its maximal forward or backward position, respectively, with 0.025 seconds margins. Perturbation that was introduced beyond this margins was considered a mid-stance perturbation. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Perturbation magnitude and timing (see experimental procedure below) were controlled and modified by the VR system computer.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/protocols-files.s3.amazonaws.com\/private\/45c04beb4f6177c66ee402e1d58b842238e8be62e88765bb11d96b1f38a837de\/b2ssbb357.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAJYFAX46LHRVQMGOA%2F20200604%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20200604T200101Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-Signature=59371ab43ccf94d821ebb3c9cebacd2918b65061a157609ed1b03b6c6cbf84ad\" \/><\/div><\/div>","created_on":0,"changed_on":0,"creator":{"name":" ","affiliation":null,"affiliations":[],"username":"","link":null,"image":{"source":"","placeholder":""},"badges":[],"verified":0,"is_verified_user":false,"research_interests":null,"blocked_by_you":false,"blocked_you":false,"hide_following":false},"comments":[]}},{"id":1054727,"guid":"76760B37CD6745FA8F817A0D1C6E3DF9","order_id":4,"type_id":26,"title":"notes","source":{"id":0,"parent_id":0,"uri":"","title":"","body":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Capturing gait parameters<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Gait speed was obtained from an encoder on the drive shaft of the treadmill motor.
