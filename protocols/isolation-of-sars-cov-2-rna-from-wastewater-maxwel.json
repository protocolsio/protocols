This finding mobilized the global water sector to investigate if wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) using the genetic signal of SARS-CoV-2 could be used to track the spread of COVID-19 in communities. In the past, WBE was critical in identifying the community prevalence of poliovirus in support of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) program to eradicate poliomyelitis. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has the potential to provide an integrated, community-level indication of the presence or prevalence of COVID-19.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The process of detecting viral genetic signatures in wastewater samples involves collection of wastewater influent at specific points in the sewage system, either as a grab sample or as a 24-hour composite sample. This is followed by optional heat pasteurization and concentration of viral matter. The viral matter and\/or its genetic signature is present at a low concentration in wastewater, making sample concentration a prerequisite for sensitive detection and utility in WBE. Concentration of viral matter can be performed using a variety of methods such as charged membrane filtration, centrifugal ultrafiltration and flocculation\/precipitation using skimmed milk, or polyethylene glycol (PEG)\/NaCl. Most of the viral concentration methods currently being used were originally developed to concentrate viral matter with the objective of culturing the virus for downstream applications, though they have been also used for direct PCR based detection. Several of the methods described above may work efficiently with several virus types, but they have proven to be inconsistent for SARS-CoV-2 RNA recovery leading to significant analytical variability. In addition, these viral concentration methods are labor intensive and time consuming.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">To address these issues, we have developed a convenient method to direct capture and concentrate total nucleic acids (TNA) from a large volume (40 ml) of wastewater using silica based a GFA\/silica column (PureYield Midi Column) and then eluted in 1ml. In a second step the material is purified and concentrated using the Maxwell\u00ae RSC system allowing walk-away-automation and with fast, reliable and consistent purification of total nucleic acid. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1616973846}
