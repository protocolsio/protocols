in Sub-Saharan Africa, where anaemia is also widespread. HIV infection is known to be associated with anaemia and various other haematologic alterations, but little data on correlation with immunological and virologic conditions in treatment-na\u00efve patients is available. To investigate these associations, we conducted a retrospective analysis of baseline data (general details, nutritional status, full blood count and HIV infection progress data) and 12 months follow-up status for HIV+ adult patients in 22 health facilities in Malawi and Mozambique.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">Among the 22.657 patients included, we found associations of sex, nutritional status, CD4 count, and VL with anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia.
