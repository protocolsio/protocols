A conventional IgG measures ~3 x 11 nm, not including the conjugated fluorochrome(s) (Reth, 2013). Antibodies conjugated to fluorescent proteins such as PE and APC (250 and 105 kDa, respectively) are considerably bigger. Furthermore, it is known that commercial antibody preparations contain some aggregates that can be misidentified as positive events if not removed (Gagnon & Beam, 2009). Therefore, choosing a method that efficiently eliminates antibody aggregates and discriminates labeled EVs from unbound antibody conjugates is crucial. Some groups have reported successful unbound antibody removal after gradient ultracentrifugation in sucrose or iodixanol or repetitive ultracentrifugation (Groot Kormelink et al., 2016; Higginbotham et al., 2016; van der Vlist et al., 2012). In this protocol, we use high-speed centrifugation to remove antibody aggregates and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to wash the unbound antibody after staining.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1603473833}
