Of all the causative factors, stress disturbance, the only one that can cause all kinds of coalmine disasters at one time, seems to exist among mining areas and to be responsible for the cluster feature. In further research, more coalmine disasters are found accompanied with micro-earthquakes, which may become the vital geophysical evidence of the tectonic stress fluctuation around mining areas. This paper lists and analyzes all the possible causative factors to demonstrate the authenticity and reliability of the new phenomena and ultimately, all the other known causative factors have been speculated and excluded. A quantitative research has been made on the cluster degree, by which the space-time distribution curves are achieved. The readers can query the ratio of disasters involved in cluster series and the number of coalmine disasters accompanied with earthquakes. For example, under the threshold of <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">10<\/span><span>0 kilometers, 47 % of disasters are involved in cluster series and 372 coalmine disasters are accompanied with earthquakes. The readers can also query the detailed distribution of the durations. Potentially, the duration of cluster series reflects that of stress disturbance. The majority cluster series lasted for 1~2 days, which are more likely related to local stress disturbance. While the minority lasting longer than 4 days correspond well with fatal earthquakes, which are speculated to be related to regional stress disturbance. In addition, all the cluster series under every threshold have been picked out successfully and a full <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/pan.baidu.com\/s\/1sjnCEh3\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">open access<\/span><\/a><span> is provided. The cluster series possess multiple properties, such as the area, the related disasters, etc., which compared with the energy and the magnitude of earthquakes, good correspondences are acquired. It indicates that the cluster series of coalmine disasters and earthquakes are linked with fatal earthquakes and may serve as footprints of stress disturbance. The paper is not anxious to set up or to prove a theory, but to makes the most common speculations on a given geological model, in which five affecting cases are analyzed. To earthquake research and disaster prevention, widely scientific significance is suggested.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1585210326}
