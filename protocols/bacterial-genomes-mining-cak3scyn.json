Our knowledge on the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by bacteria is constantly expanding, thereby adding new information that connects biosynthetic genes with metabolites of particular chemical classes. With the cost-effective and rapid increase in the number of bacterial genomes sequenced, one challenge encountered in current drug discovery efforts is how to effectively prioritize those strains with
