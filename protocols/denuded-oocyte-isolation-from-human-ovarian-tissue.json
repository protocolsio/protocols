Here, we do not outline steps for removing the ovarian cortex from the organ and slicing 1 mm thick sections, nor do we outline cryopreservation and tissue thawing methods. Tissue is digested enzymatically using Collagenase IA and DNase I then follicles are isolated from the digested tissue first using cell strainers and then by individual collection from the suspension. Follicles are further digested enzymatically until oocytes can be collected by hand.
