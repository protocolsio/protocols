In the aforementioned protein-linker reactions, either AChE and BTX solution was incubated with corresponding cross linkers at a molar ratio of 1:20 to keep the balance between linkage efficiency and protein activity. Assembled DNA scaffolds were pretreated with TCEP for 1.5 h at RT to cleave the disulfide bonds and then removed from excess TCEP via Amicon centrifugal filters (30k cut-off) prior to enzyme conjugation. Maleimide- functionalized AChE was later vortexed with the DNA scaffold at a molar ratio of 5:1 for 2 h. Afterwards, TCO-functionalized BTX was added to the reaction mixture at a BTX to DNA molar ratio of 20:1, allowing a TCO-tetrazine ligation reaction between BTX and the DNA scaffold for another 2 h.

The salivary duct was carefully stretched with an insect pin as a metal harp (Warner Instruments) was placed on top to suppress and stabilize the SMG (Fig. 2). After placing the chamber onto the microscope stage, 200 \u03bcL of freshly prepared Ringer\u2019s buffer (pH=7.3-7.4) was added under the 63x water-immersion objective, followed by 500 \u03bcL injections of ACh solutions ranging in concentration from 0.001 \u03bcM to 10 mM. The final concentration of ACh was adjusted based on a dilution factor of 1.4. The entire experiment was performed using an Olympus BX61WI fluorescence microscope. After each measurement, the ACh solution was carefully removed using Kimwipes, followed by three rounds of washing with Ringer\u2019s buffer. The sample was then immersed and incubated in the buffer for 10 min to enable the nanosensor to recover to baseline fluorescence signals.
