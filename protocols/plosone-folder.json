According to the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) report, surgical site infections account for 14%\u2013 16% of hospital infections among hospitalized patients [4]. The SSIs increase the average number of days of hospitalization by 6.5 days, with additional hospitalization costs of $18,900, while the cost of patient mortality is $60,547 more than patient survival[5]. Korean studies show that the additional days of hospitalization due to surgical site infections increase by 5.2 days, with an additional cost of more than $1,800 per incident[6]. Therefore, surgical site infections lead to mental, physical, and economic losses to patients, worsen quality of life, waste healthcare resources, and increase financial burden on medical institutions.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>The results of the 2006 Survey on Antibiotic Usage at the National Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (HIRA) showed that the use of prophylactic antibiotics in Korean surgeries differed from that in the Guideline for Guidance and has classified as an abuse of antibiotics [7, 8].

In recent studies, sufficient medical institutions and research subjects are not available, which limits research results [9, 10]. Since the start of the national hospital evaluation program (NHEP) in 2008, evaluation of prophylactic antibiotics for surgery was started as a comprehensive measure of antibiotic resistance management. In this evaluation program, unfavorable antibiotic choice were defined as over third-generation cephalosporin, aminoglycoside, combination of \u03b2-lactam with aminoglycoside, combination of vancomycin with other antibiotics. The following procedures performed from 2008 were included for assessment in the NHEP and the result of clinical performance were officially reported to public as well as to each hospital. As the hospital assessment progressed, we were forced to abandon the use of antibiotics to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and changed third-generation cephalosporin. <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The third-generation prophylactic antibiotic, which was used from 2009 to 2012, were changed to the first-generation prophylactic antibiotic because of evaluation of prophylactic antibiotics. The use of prophylactic antibiotics has been evaluated since 2012 to promote the prevention of SSIs. The benefit of university hospital institution due to prophylactic antibiotic changes has not been identified. Therefore, we performed a comparative study of cephalosporin first-generation (cefazolin) and third-generation (ceftizoxime) antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of prophylactic antibiotics and the prevention of surgical site infections by analyzing the relationships between the use of prophylactic antibiotics and surgical site infection rates. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Materials and methods<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Study population<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This study was a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of all patients who underwent cardiac surgery from January 01, 2009, to December 31, 2016, at a single university hospital. All patients had undergone a full median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The inclusion criteria were coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve surgery. Patients with current active infections, those for whom antibiotics had been administered within two weeks of surgery, immunotherapy patients, patients with congenital heart disease or cardiac assistive devices or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and patients who had undergone aortic dissection or thoracotomy surgeries were excluded from the study. Of the 539 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, 228 received third-generation antibiotics (ceftizoxime) and 311 received first-generation antibiotics (cefazolin). According to the exclusion criterion, 27 patients in the third-generation group and 45 patients in the first-generation group were excluded. The final study included 201 patients in the third-generation group and 266 in the first-generation group. Following propensity score matching, a total of 194 patients were categorized into the two groups (Fig. 1).

Because the timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration is important in preventing surgical site infections, we defined the antibiotic drug regimen as optimal prophylaxis if the antibiotic was administered within one hour before the first surgical incision. All preoperative procedures were conducted in the same way. The patients were given a chlorhexidine shower to reduce bacterial proliferation and prevent infection before surgery. The surgical site was disinfected with a 7.5% povidone-iodine (Polydine Cleanser, Dr Fisher), and hair was removed with a hair removal cream (Silk Plus Hair Removal Cream, Nimson). In the operating room, on the day of surgery, all operative sites were scrubbed with 7.5% povidone-iodine soap solution and painted with 3M DuraPrep surgical solution (0.7% iodine-povacrylex, 3M Health) again. All surgical procedures were done under conventional cardiopulmonary bypass conditions and moderate hypothermia (30\u2103-32\u2103) with a heater-cooler unit. All operations were performed by two experienced cardiac surgeons. The surgical procedures have not been changed to date. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Surgical site infection<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The sternal incision sites were evaluated daily by cardiac surgeons and four times a week by an infection management nurse.

All patients were followed-up one week hospital discharge and all patients visited an outpatient department every week. The duration of the surgical site infection assessments was within 30 days from the beginning of follow-up to the end of follow-up, based on the surgical site infection guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)[11]. Nosocomial surgical site infections (SSIs) were defined according to the CDC criteria and mediastinitis was defined according to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) criteria [12, 13].

The first-generation and third-generation groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio using the Greedy matching method [17].

The first-generation group showed excellent antimicrobial effects on \u03b2-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci and remained stable for a long time at infection rates. As a result of comparing hospitalization between the two groups, preoperative hospitalization duration, mean operation time, and the ventilator time were similar in both groups, but hospitalization duration after surgery was significantly shorter in the first-generation antibiotic group.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>This study was conducted to identify the use of prophylactic antibiotics and the source of infections and provide basic data for establishing antibiotic use guidelines. In a previous study, no differences were found in SSI rates after cardiac surgery between the third-generation and first-generation antibiotic groups, although a difference was found in antibiotic dosage and usage [19, 20]. However, in this study, while no differences in superficial SSI rates were observed between the third- and first-generation groups, significantly lower were found in the rates of all SSIs and deep SSIs\/mediastinitis rates were found in the first-generation group. Superficial SSIs may have been caused by impaired cutaneous circulation, whereas deep SSIs may reflect the relationship between tissue perfusion and infection, including muscle, bone, and the mediastinum in the surgical site and are less frequent than superficial SSIs but have a shorter duration to diagnosis and higher mortality and morbidity. Deep SSIs are one of the most destructive of cardiac surgery complications in patients and are different than superficial SSIs. Because the potential infection associations are substantially different, different treatment methods and strategies should be established. Therefore, the high incidence of deep SSIs in the third-generation group is confounded by complex complications and surgical treatment, which leads to increased ICU stays and re-admission rates and double the risk of mortality [21]. The effect of SSIs is influenced by antibiotic resistance and the number of infections [22]. Gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were cultured from the SSIs of 67% and 23% of the patients in the third-generation group and from 62% and 24% of the patients in the first-generation group, respectively. <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S aureus<\/span><span> and coagulase-negative S<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">taphylococci<\/span><span>, known to be important pathogens responsible for SSIs in heart surgery, are frequently resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [23, 24]. We found that the patients who received third-generation antibiotics for prophylaxis became significantly more colonized with methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative bacteria and <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">S aureus<\/span><span>than the first-generation group. We observed a trend toward more SSIs in the patients who received third-generation antibiotic prophylaxis. Thus, SSIs caused by methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci were more common among patients who received third-generation antibiotics.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Considering that the antimicrobial characteristics of the two antibiotics differ, it is appropriate to use first-generation antibiotics because they have excellent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and maintain a narrow range of antimicrobial activity. In addition, first-generation antibiotics are more effective in reducing medical costs and increasing safety because they have been used for a long time and are inexpensive. Bratzler et al.[21, 25] warned that the use of prophylactic antibiotics that are incompatible with guidelines is not only less effective in reducing SSIs, but the use of antibiotics over excessively broad antimicrobial ranges may increase the tolerance of other organisms. Barie et al.[26] reported that the choice of the appropriate prophylactic antibiotic is important to cover the range of surgical wound infection organisms and the use of inappropriate prophylactic antibiotics is not effective in reducing surgical wound infection rates. According to Bratzler et al.[21] prophylactic antibiotic selection recommends the use of narrow antibiotic ranges and long-used antibiotics due to factors such as cost, half-life, safety, and antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the newer and broader range of antibiotics should be avoided, as they may increase tolerance. This study did not show any clear advantage of newer and broader range third-generation antibiotics in reducing SSI rates and methicillin-resistant infections in cardiac surgery. In addition, the preoperative conditions, surgical procedures and technique, and antibiotic administration were similar in both groups but differed significantly in the effectiveness to prevent infection. Considering the stability, resistance and efficacy of the antibiotics, first-generation (cefazolin) antibiotics are suitable prophylactic drugs for heart surgery.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>The duration of hospital stay in the first-generation group was significantly shorter than in the third-generation group. The preoperative hospital stay, operating time, and duration of ventilator use did not differ between the two groups. However, in the first-generation group, the duration of ICU stay and hospitalization were both significantly shorter than in the third-generation group. In addition, in the ICU stay comparison between the all-infection group (n = 82) and the non-infection group (n = 306), the mean duration of ventilator use was 2.5 \u00b1 3.7 days vs 0.99 \u00b1 1.4 days (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">p<\/span><span><0.001), the mean ICU stay duration was 7.3 \u00b1 4.8 days vs 2.4 \u00b1 1.4 days (p<0.001) respectively, were significantly higher in all-infection group. This result may reflect the increased susceptibility to surgical site infections with the long-term use of ventilators and increased ICU stay duration, leading to increased treatment due to infection. Lola et al.[27] reported that patients using ventilator for more than 48hours in the ICU had five-fold higher SSI rates and were eight-fold more likely to be readmitted to the ICU due to complications. Therefore, the significant difference in the hospitalization duration between the two groups suggests that long-term ventilator use and ICU stay duration were the independent risk factors of SSIs. More effective effort and attention are, therefore, needed for ventilator management and hand hygiene promotion activities in the ICU to prevent infections.<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Prophylactic antibiotic prices vary slightly from manufacturer to manufacturer, but the first-generation is the oldest drug in the cephalosporin family and has the lowest cost. The costs of prophylactic antibiotics may be reflected in the overall cost of patient care and treatment. The total medical care expenditure was about 5,800 USD higher in the third generation group, excluding pre-surgery examination fees, cardiac surgery costs, and material cost for the treatment. In particular, while no difference was observed in total medical expenditures between patients in the non-SSIs group, a significant difference was found in the all-SSIs group. Third-generation antibiotic prophylaxis affected the length of hospitalization and increased the cost of medical care. This was reflected in increases in the SSI rate, hospitalization duration, and the medical expenditures for additional treatments [28]. In addition, if indirect costs that were not evaluated in this study, were added, SSI could result in significant economic losses. Therefore, the active promotion of SSI prevention activities is necessary.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">This study had several limitations as a prophylactic antibiotic study. First, the SSI rate was higher than that of a previous study [20]. The patients were followed-up within 30 days of surgery, and SSIs were judged according to the findings of the clinical physician, rather than the infection specialist physician. As such, the clinical physician might overestimate wound infections. Second, while all patients underwent the same surgical procedure, the enrollment period was eight years. After adjusting the enrollment period to confirm the SSI rates and errors due to long-term studies, and this study was able to reduce some of the distortion (S2 Tables). Third, the long-term enrollment results numbers of patients with SSIs are insufficient. Further studies are needed to identify additional interrelated risk factors, including various variables that can affect SSIs. The prophylactic antibiotic treatment duration and the incidence of SSIs need to be established through randomized clinical trials. In addition, further scientific results from investigations, such as accurate confirmation of the occurrence of SSIs and determining the appropriate dose period, are needed.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">The results of this study showed that the use of third-generation prophylactic antibiotics increased the surgical site infection rate and the length of hospital stay compared to the use of first-generation antibiotics. In addition, the microbial cultures showed that the numbers of gram-positive bacteria and antibiotic resistant organisms at the surgical site were high. It is, therefore, important to select suitable prophylactic antibiotics. The selection of first-generation prophylactic antibiotics, with their long-term safety and low cost, was effective in reducing the rate of surgical site infections and decreasing hospitalization and medical expenditures.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Supporting information<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">S1 Tables.
