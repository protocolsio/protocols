In this method we assume that even though the sizes of the two child populations are different, the sum of them will always correspond to the size of the ancestral population. The procedure is based on the comparison of intra and inter populational (\u03c0's) diversities that have a large variance, which means that for short divergence times, the average diversity found within the population may be higher than that observed among populations. These calculations should therefore be made if the assumptions of a pure fission model are met and if the divergence time is relatively old. The results of this simulation show that this procedure leads to better results than other methods that do not take into account unequal population sizes, especially when the relative sizes of the daughter populations are in fact unequal. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Accurate population differentiation tests<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">We at LaBECom understand that this test is an analog of fisher's exact test in a 2x2 contingency table extended to a rxk contingency table.

These data suggest that the relative degree of structuring present in these two countries may be related to gene flow. These structuring levels were also supported by simple phylogenetic pairing methodologies such as UPGMA, which in this case, with a discontinuous pattern of genetic divergence between the groups (supports the idea of possible sub-geographical isolations resulting from past fragmentation events), was observed a not so numerous amount of branches in the tree generated and with few mutational steps.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">These few mutations have possibly not yet been fixed by drift by the lack of the founding effect, which accompanies the behavior of dispersion and\/or loss of intermediate haplotypes throughout the generations.

This consideration provides the safety that, although there are differences in the haplotypes studied, these differences are minimal in geographically distinct regions and thus it seems safe to extrapolate the levels of polymorphism and molecular diversity found in the samples of this study to other genomes of other South American countries, reducing speculation about the existence of rapid and silent mutations that , although they exist as we have shown in this work, they can significantly increase the genetic variability of the Virus, making it difficult to work with molecular targets for vaccines and drugs in general.<\/div><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#ff9994","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1040258,"guid":"0DFEC540005611EB8C5045A8027F8983","previous_id":1030864,"previous_guid":"71644E00F63511EABA4C0BC66A5AB535","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"6900C66CF44C418AA96677665BD4D754","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Results"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"ED4E6CCCF0B54DB18942E4C62222668E","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>Genetic distance and molecular variation (AMOVA) analyses were not significant for the groups studied, presenting a variation component of 0.12 between populations and 4.46 within populations.
