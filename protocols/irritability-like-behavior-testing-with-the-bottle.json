class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Procedure:\nTesting usually begins during the dark cycle of the animals under dark conditions with a red light for researchers but may vary depending on the experiment.\n\n\nA session consists of 10 trials in a clean plastic cage (26.67 cm \u00d7 48.26 cm \u00d7 20.32 cm; Ancare, Bellmore, NY, USA) with fresh bedding. \n\n\nA trial begins with the rat positioned at the back of the cage and the rat should be moved to the back of the cage if not there, trials occurring with the rat starting elsewhere should be disregarded.\n\n\nThe person performing the brushing inserts the bottle-brush into the cage from the front, rotating towards the rats\u2019 whiskers for approximately 3 seconds. The brush should make contact with the rat for approximately a second on the whiskers.\n\n\nThe rotating brush is then retreated to the front of the cage over the course of a second.\n\n\nThe brush then is hung vertically for approximately 2 seconds (without rotating) before being removed entirely from the cage. This step and the previous step allow for the rat to follow the brush to the resting point and bite, paw at and inspect the brush if they choose to.\n\n\nRemoval of the brush from the cage indicates the end of a trial, which should be repeated 10 times. After a 5 second gap the trial is repeated.\n\n\nDuring the trial the 2-3 observers identify behavioral responses that are categorized into aggressive and defensive. Each behavior that occurs in a given trial is recorded between the trials on scoresheets. A behavior occurring in an individual trial results in a tally mark for that behavior in that given trial on the scoresheet.\n\n\nAt the end of the sessions the total score for each behavior (and aggressive or defensive behaviors) are tallied for each rat and the average across observers is taken.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":[],"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><h1>Irritability Protocol<\/h1><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We use the bottle-brush test to test for irritability-like behavior see previous studies for examples (Kononoff et al., 2018, Kimbrough et al., 2017).
