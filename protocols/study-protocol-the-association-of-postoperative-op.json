Patients are included if they underwent one of nine procedural categories between January 1, 2017 and October 31, 2019. The primary exposure of interest is being prescribed an opioid upon hospital discharge. The primary outcome is the incidence of new persistent opioid use between groups, defined as filling at least one opioid prescription between post-discharge days 4-90 and filling at least one opioid prescription between post-discharge days 91-180. Secondary outcomes are the incidence of new persistent opioid use by each procedure, the incidence of new persistent use among patients who received a postoperative opioid prescription by quartiles of total prescription size, and a sensitivity analysis to compare new persistent use among patients who experienced a 30-day clinic event and patients who did not experience a 30-day clinical event.
