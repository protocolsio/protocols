Most dyes have only ROS-sensitive components, but ROS-insensitive fluorescent references were missing. Moreover, maintaining the explants on physiological conditions during fluorescent microscope visualization is not always possible, hence imaging conditions may induce changes in ROS levels (Tosheva et al., 2020). To overcome these problems, we adapted the well-known DCHBS\/AAP method (Van Gestelen et al., 1998) based on peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7)-dependent oxidation of 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid (DHBS) to form red coloration product with absorbance at 510 nm.

In most cases, NBT staining of plant tissues is performed in buffers, such as 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.1 (Dunand et al., 2007) or Tris-HCl at pH 9.5 (Kagenishi et al., 2016), that have a strong effect on superoxide production and that are non-physiological for plants.

Hence, we cannot directly extrapolate the amount of formazan formation to the endogenous ROS levels. Another problem of this method is that NBT incubation of plant tissues led to some browning. Therefore, quantification of the formazan (blue) spots is normally performed after aggressively clearing plant tissues with chloral hydrate. In these conditions though, some plant cells that do not contain the formazan precipitate are also stained, and this needs to be considered for endogenous ROS quantification in these cells (Javvaji et al., 2020).<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#f3ff94","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1248534,"guid":"4E9B6E80122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","previous_id":1248531,"previous_guid":"467B9E10122111EC81F54B5CB55DE657","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"9EC25F01F20045D78D071F3581928AC4","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"H2O2 detection with H2DCFDA"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"E01FF2699BBB49E595247CE17A9EA17B","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Step 2. <\/span><span>Add H<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2<\/span><span>DCFDA from the stock solution (2 mM in DMSO) to the final concentration of 1 \u00b5M.<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1248535,"guid":"5E69C1E0122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","previous_id":1248534,"previous_guid":"4E9B6E80122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"9CC521665E7B4603A32B1B06430214A5","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"H2O2 detection with H2DCFDA"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"71B98ACD11EB4BB785094906A83FE305","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Step 3.<\/span><span> Incubate for 20 min in the dark.<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1248536,"guid":"707B9CA0122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","previous_id":1248535,"previous_guid":"5E69C1E0122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"CC03963BFA4444048BD86933247525FC","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"H2O2 detection with H2DCFDA"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"45B8CC592DDF4BCF811187D72949F21D","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Step 4.<\/span><span> Carefully mount on the microscopic slide: Take 150-200 \u00b5l of the medium, load to the slides, and carefully transfer seedlings and cover them with coverslip.<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1248537,"guid":"854A4D70122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","previous_id":1248536,"previous_guid":"707B9CA0122211EC81F54B5CB55DE657","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"CCF260C8594248A797920AC81250E386","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"H2O2 detection with H2DCFDA"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"C19192708479422A8F9F6230EC9E4BF0","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Step 5.<\/span><span> Observe samples under an epifluorescent microscope with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 530 nm.\n<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Note:<\/span><span> H<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">2<\/span><span>DCFDA is very sensitive to light and can rapidly be oxidized.

ROS formation naturally occurred during electron transport through all membranes which, in turn, regulate DNA repair systems, cell cycle, phytohormone-dependent signalling and pathogen integration (Huang et al., 2019). In the non-photosynthetic plant tissue, the mitochondrial electron transport system of oxidative phosphorylation is the major site for ROS generation (Dourmap et al., 2020). While in photosynthetic tissue, electron transport between stroma and thylakoid is the primary ROS source (Asada, 2006). On plasma membranes and on endoplasmic reticulum membranes, ROS is mainly produced via NADPH oxidases (Foreman et al., 2003).Cell wall peroxidases are another source of apoplastic ROS (Torres, 2010).

Hydroxyl radicals are thus generated in the cell wall, plasma membrane, and intracellularly by a range of peroxidases, superoxide dismutases, NADPH oxidases, and transition metal catalysts (Richards et al., 2015). <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Because of the cellular and biochemical damage caused by oxidative stress (Huang et al., 2019), ROS levels should be precisely controlled in each subcellular compartment and each cell type. ROS are highly reactive molecules rapidly subjected to scavenging or degradation, in processes that are highly sensitive to any environmental change, therefore making ROS extremely unstable and difficult to directly detect. Transferring of the plants to buffers with non-physiological pH can be considered as an abiotic stress factor and it eventually might change endogenous ROS levels (Choudhury et al., 2017). However, many established protocols for ROS measurement (Dunand et al., 2007, Jambunathan, 2010, Rodr\u00edguez & Taleisnik, 2012) included the soaking of plant tissues on non-physiological buffers, which might alter steady-state ROS levels. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Several methods have been used for ROS localization and they rely on histochemistry, fluorescent dyes, and spectrophotometric measurements (Mittler et al., 2011).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Histochemistry<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>Histochemical methods are based on the oxidation of dyes in the presence of ROS, resulting in the production of insoluble precipitates.
