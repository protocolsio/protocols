The strength  of the electrostatic interactions is varied by the Bjerrum length of  the solvent. It turns out that average extension of a PE scales with the  degree of polymerization, very much similar to a neutral polymer chain  in good solvent. Remarkably, the difference between a PE and a neutral  chain appears to be solely in the correlations among monomers which are  stored in the Virial coefficients. Interestingly, upon increasing the  Bjerrum length of solvent, the chain shrinks. This outcome is confirmed  by the DFT framework as well as the MD simulations. The significance of this study is that it strongly criticizes the idea (already mentioned in T. Kreer, <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Soft Matter<\/span><span>, <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">12<\/span><span>,  3479 (2016)) that the PEs behave similar to a neutral ideal chain.
