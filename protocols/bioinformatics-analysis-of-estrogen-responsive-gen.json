The Genomic HyperBrowser allows one to calculate the enrichment of estrogen receptor-binding sites with the intervals generated above (i.e., within 5 kb of estrogen DEGs). Figure 3 illustrates this process. It is possible to use the Genomic HyperBrowser to calculate an empirical p-value for this overlap using the same tab as for enrichment analysis but selecting \u201cCategory: Hypothesis testing,\u201d \u201cOverlap?,\u201d a suitable null model (e.g., \u201cPreserve segments (T2), segment lengths and inter-segment gaps (T1); randomize positions (T1) (MC)\u201d) and the number of permutations (e.g., for publication quality p-values ~10,000 permutations would be recommended). The region and scale tab is also important as this determines in which areas of the genome randomized tracks can fall. Leaving it at its default value (all chromosome arms) is adequate for the current sanity check. There is significant overlap between ESR1-binding sites and estrogen DEGs (2.14-fold, p < 10\u22124), which suggests that there are likely to be plausible direct estrogen targets amongst the transcriptomic dataset. Note that analyses are only conducted on bed files, and so if the track of interest is not offered by the Genomic HyperBrowser as a potential track for analysis then edit that track to ensure that the track type is \u201cbed.\u201d<\/div><\/div><br\/><br\/><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/ebg6fw26.jpg\" \/><\/div><br\/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"1CCABBA5735A420E83F2C5FA2BFE1C75","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/ebg6fw26.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1060969,"guid":"E60FA850162C11EBAA0C279E1F359550","previous_id":1060967,"previous_guid":"56B44940162C11EBAA0C279E1F359550","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"62A9C8356D734BA089DFD18124194FFC","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.1 The Genomic HyperBrowser"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"5CEB12736FD34B069063D0B895884A3F","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Identifying potential direct estrogen targets is simply a matter of joining estrogen DEGs (\u00b15 kb) to ESR1-binding sites (Fig. 4).<\/div><br\/><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/ebhqfw26.jpg\" \/><\/div><br\/><\/div>"}},{"id":1054725,"guid":"89EE3875012F489AB712CBB7F3B2DEED","order_id":2,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/ebhqfw26.jpg\" \/><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1060970,"guid":"4BEFACB0162D11EBAA0C279E1F359550","previous_id":1060969,"previous_guid":"E60FA850162C11EBAA0C279E1F359550","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"A656BDA67E9F4D12AE8507CB440345A0","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.1 The Genomic HyperBrowser"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"0A954132611D452D875BABD9C5BEB87C","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">The resultant output can be pasted into a spreadsheet program and filtered to obtain unique gene IDs and their respective ESR1-binding sites.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1060971,"guid":"552A0A50162D11EBAA0C279E1F359550","previous_id":1060970,"previous_guid":"4BEFACB0162D11EBAA0C279E1F359550","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"D5285F3A7AB44C51AC61B1008765E75D","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"3.2 BETA"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"CA210336727E422FB4F4FD9C08FC96FE","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Register for Galaxy\/Cistrome (<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cistrome.org\/ap\/\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">http:\/\/cistrome.org\/ap\/<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">).

These bind to DNA and modulate the expression of target genes. Identification of estrogen target genes is greatly facilitated by the use of transcriptomic methods, such as RNA-seq and expression microarrays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq). Combining transcriptomic and ChIP-seq data enables a distinction to be drawn between direct and indirect estrogen target genes. This chapter discusses some methods of identifying estrogen target genes that do not require any expertise in programming languages or complex bioinformatics.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1630617628}
