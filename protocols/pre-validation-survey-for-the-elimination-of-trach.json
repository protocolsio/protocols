A suitable surveillance strategy is therefore required to provide evidence that elimination prevalence targets have been sustained and to identify any potential resurgence of disease.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">After initial baseline prevalence surveys in 2000, Ghana initiated a programme to eliminate blinding trachoma in the Northern and Upper West Regions. Full SAFE interventions started in 5 districts where trachoma was found to be a public health problem. An evaluation survey conducted in the first five districts after two years of implementing control activities showed between 41-79% reduction in the prevalence of active trachoma [Ghana Health Service Trachoma Control Programme 2003]. The SAFE strategy was extended to a sixth district in 2002 and after completing baseline surveys in all areas, by 2004 endemic communities in all districts in the two regions received full SAFE. With a full knowledge of trachoma endemic areas, the National Trachoma Control Program developed a five year strategic plan (2005-2009) to guide trachoma control activities [Ghana Health Service 2005]. The plan set various targets with the ultimate goal to eliminate blinding trachoma from Ghana by 2010. The plan also provided benchmarks to assess programme performance, such as evaluating the impact of at least three years of SAFE strategy on the prevalence of disease.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Currently, Ghana is one of the countries in the post-endemic surveillance stage [WHO 2012]. Following a post-intervention impact assessment in 2008 after all endemic communities had received at least three years of SAFE interventions, the prevalence of TF fell to 0.14-2.87% from a baseline of 2.8-16.1% in 2003 [Yayemain et al. 2009]. These results revealed that Ghana has reached the ultimate intervention goal of reducing TF in children aged 1-9 years to <5.0% in all endemic districts. However, in order to achieve elimination of blinding trachoma, it is required that TF in children aged 1-9 years remains at <5% after interventions to control trachoma have ceased [Resnikoff et al. 2007, WHO 2013]. Further, the target threshold for elimination of trichiasis is a prevalence of TT <0.1% in 15 years and older. TT prevalence fell from 0.4-8.4% in 2003 to 0.05-1.07% in 2008 [Yayemain et al. 2009], but is still above the recommended threshold for validation of elimination in some districts (Table 1).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Following the post-intervention impact assessment, a post MDA surveillance strategy was put in place between 2011 and 2014, conducting both active and passive surveillance for Trachomatous Inflammation- Follicular (TF) and Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) cases [GHS, 2010]. The surveillance strategy included the following:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Passive surveillance for TT cases in all health facilities, integrated into the Integrated Disease Surveillance Report (IDSR) reporting<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">A convenience sample of children (aged 1-9 years) in two communities per year assessed for signs of TF.

Relying on an indicator that has low specificity and may over-estimate the prevalence of infection in the community can result in a waste of valuable resources, especially if potential \u2018hotspots\u2019 of infection are wrongfully identified and antibiotics are unnecessarily distributed. \u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Alternative indicators to provide evidence for elimination have been suggested and tested in a number of settings. Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT), including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific tests [Keenan et al, 2012; Mabey and Solomon, 2003] however it is not yet clear how to use the results in program decision making. In addition, the NAAT tests for C. trachomatis infection are still quite expensive and must be conducted by specialised technicians in a laboratory where a NAAT platform is available, which may or may not be readily available in-country.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The use of serological tests (detecting antibody responses to chlamydial antigens e.g pgp3 and CT694) [Goodhew et al, 2012; Goodhew et al, 2014] provides an opportunity to determine prevalence of exposure to infection and if combined with age can potentially give a useful indicator of transmission intensity over time (especially after antibiotic distribution was stopped). The use of multiplex assays also provides the opportunity to integrate tests for a number of other pathogens using the same sera, saving costs across public health programmes. Further research is required in order to determine the interpretation and potential utility of using the prevalence of antibodies to C. trachomatis in decision-making around the elimination of blinding trachoma.\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Further evidence is also required in order to better understand the thresholds for potential resurgence of infection and the implications. It is believed that repeated exposure to C. trachomatis bacteria is necessary for an immunopathologic response in an individual. If infection levels remain low this progression in sequelae and potential blindness, may not be a concern [Grayston et al, 1991; Bobo et al, 1985; Detels et al, 1966]. It is currently difficult to predict and determine the significance of potential re-emergence of infection.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"about:blank#_ftnref1\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">[1]<\/span><\/a><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"> Less than 5% prevalence Trachomatous Inflammation, Follicular (TF) in children aged 1-9 years and less than 0.1% prevalence of Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) in adults aged 15 and over.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":575997,"guid":"ECFCB01700554B2098A5038C320CE3D2","previous_id":575996,"previous_guid":"DDE6809E6A524C69A31CB5D6D396E57E","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"C73DF87838554159815F9F2165E9BF7F","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"Expected Outcomes"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"2A8A364D304C40C5BE1AD00226E86955","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><a href=\"\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\">Results from this pre-validation trachoma surveillance strategy will provide the Ghana Health Service (GHS) with evidence as to whether the country has sustained their elimination targets for trachoma.

The primary sampling unit, the village (or enumeration area), will be selected probability proportional to size. A list of all villages with respective populations will be compiled for each mother district. All communities with population greater than 5000 and less than 200 will be excluded. Twenty-four clusters will be selected in each district. The total cumulative population of the district will be divided by 24, to obtain the sampling interval. A random number between 1 and the sampling interval will be generated to select the first cluster. The sampling interval will then be successively added to select the remaining 23 clusters.\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The secondary sampling unit, the household, will be randomly selected using the household listing approach, or if household lists at the village level is not easily attainable, compact segment sampling.

Only children aged 1-9 years old will have samples taken for analysis.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Outline of compact segment sampling: When the team gets to the village, they will meet the highest-ranking village leader and seek consent. Once permission is granted, the village leader will be asked to provide information on the number of households in the village. If the number of households is greater than the required number (for this study we require 40 households per village, see sample size calculations below), a sketch map and household listing of the village will be required.\u00a0 If the number of households is 40 or less, all households in the village would be examined.\u00a0 Several people can help with the listing on the sketch map: the village chief, elders, community health worker and trachoma volunteer. The village boundaries will be drawn orienting the North, South, East and West, along with key landmarks or easily identifiable points in the village e.g internal paths, churches, schools, water points. All households will be marked per their location within the village.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">All households will be grouped into segments of 20 households and each segment numbered. A corresponding number for each segment will be written on a piece of paper that will be placed in a container such as a cup or hat. After all the pieces of paper have been mixed together, two segments will be selected at random (by someone from the village) and these will represent the two segments to be surveyed. All households in the segment selected will be surveyed.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Selected households will not be replaced when residents are absent or refuse examination.\u00a0 To minimize the number of residents missed in selected households, survey teams will re-visit the household before leaving the village on the day of the survey.\u00a0<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">ii) Sample size calculations for district level survey<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">The sample size was calculated for the required precision of TF in children aged 1-9 years old, based on the following parameters:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Prevalence of TF (p): 4%<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Precision (d): +\/- 2%<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\u00a0Z value (z): 1.96 or 95% confidence level<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Design Effect: 3.3<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Expected non-response: 10%<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Using the following formula:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sample Size= z2(p(1-p))\/d2<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Taking into account the design effect and non-response, this gives a total sample size of 1,338 children aged 1-9 years old, per evaluation unit (District).\u00a0The above sample size is per evaluation unit.

As above, all children aged 1-9 years in the village (or a minimum of 329 children) will be each assessed for clinical signs, ocular C. trachomatis infection and antibody levels. It should be noted that although ocular swabs will be taken from all villages included in the focal screening activity, analysis of ocular C. trachomatis infection (using PCR) will be prioritised to the \u2018index\u2019 villages and only extended to neighbouring villages if the index village has any positive samples. This is because the PCR process is time consuming and expensive and there is a necessity to prioritise samples for analysis. Antibody levels will be tested in all villages.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Basic information about the social dynamics of the villages e.g ethnicity, points of interaction of children under five e,g pre-schools or nursery, place of worship, water points, trade centres, will also be collected.

The objective is to compare the incremental cost and benefits of different options for active surveillance (i.e. school screening, community screening for TF, and sentinel sites for TT) versus passive surveillance (used as a comparator). Costing data will be based on actual expenditures collected from project and GHS records. The effect of each surveillance component will be calculated using the number of TF and TT cases detected.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":null,"section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":"","materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Background<\/span><span>: In order to achieve elimination of blinding trachoma, a country needs to demonstrate that the elimination prevalence thresholds have been surpassed and then sustained for a three year period. Ghana achieved the thresholds in 2008, and since 2011 have been implementing their trachoma surveillance strategy, which includes community and school screening for signs of follicular trachoma and trichiasis, in each trachoma-endemic district. In 2015, the country plans to conduct a number of district level population based survey to verify elimination of blinding trachoma. This decision is currently made based on prevalence of clinical evaluation of \u201ctrachomatous trichiasis\u201d and \u201ctrachomatous inflammation \u2013 follicular\u201d (TF), the second of which has been shown to be a problematic indicator in low prevalence settings. Further evidence is required to determine the optimal surveillance strategy and indicators for trachoma.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objectives<\/span><span>: This study will determine if Ghana has sustained the elimination prevalence thresholds. Additionally, the study will review the trachoma surveillance strategy employed in Ghana and if it was able to identify any potential resurgence of infection. It will also assess the relationships between the prevalence of the clinical sign TF, compared to prevalence of infection and antibody levels, after completion of what most observers believe to have been a successful programme. This will help to determine whether it may be appropriate to consider one or more alternative indicators for validating elimination of blinding trachoma. Surveillance for other infections (including yaws and other NTDs) will also be integrated into the pre-validation trachoma survey.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods<\/span><span>: The standard World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended population-based prevalence survey will be conducted in areas already scheduled to conduct validation surveys in 2015, but with the addition of eye swabbing to test for infection and finger pricking to collect bloodspots for antibody testing. Villages identified with a TF prevalence \u22655%, either retrospectively, during the on-going surveillance or during the district level survey (index village), will result in focal screening of children in neighbouring villages (and the \u2018index\u2019 village), including a clinical assessment and tests for trachoma infection and antibody levels. Surveillance for additional infections will also be included through antibody testing using the same sera collected for trachoma. Finally, document analysis and qualitative methodologies will be employed to review the operationalization of the trachoma surveillance system in Ghana.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Impact:<\/span><span> Results from this study will provide the Ghana Health Service with evidence, as to whether the country has sustained their elimination targets for trachoma. It will also inform the WHO-led Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020 (GET2020) on the appropriateness of alternative indicators and surveillance methodologies for verification of blinding trachoma.<\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1624904102}
