This combinatorial heavy metal staining protocol employs a battery of contrasting steps after primary aldehyde fixation including: ferrocyanide reduced osmium tetroxide post fixation, thiocarbohydrazide-osmium liganding (OTO) and subsequent uranyl acetate and en bloc lead aspartate staining. Calcium chloride is included in a number of steps to enhance membrane preservation and staining. This protocol was designed primarily to emphasize the contrast of membranes.

Silver paint (Ted Pella) is used to electrically ground the exposed edges of the tissue block to the aluminum pin taking care not to get the paint on the block face or edges of embedded tissue that will ultimately be sectioned.
