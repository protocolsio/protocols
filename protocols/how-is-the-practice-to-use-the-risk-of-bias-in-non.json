NRSI is becoming an important part of systematic reviews (SRs) to investigate long-term outcomes and adverse outcomes. Indeed, 63 % of SR protocols included NRSI [2-4]. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Systematic reviewers are encouraged to use the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for the assessment of the risk of bias (RoB) in each outcome in each NRSI according to the Cochrane handbook [1, 5, 6]. ROBINS-I is a domain-based assessment tool in which several types of biases to assess separately. The tool has a comprehensive manual to instruct users whereas previous tools for RoB in NRSI, such as the Newcastle-Ottawa tool and the Downs-Black tool, do not meet such characteristics [7, 8]. ROBINS-I is one of the most used RoB tools in SR protocols including NRSI [4].<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">However, there have been several inappropriate uses for the assessment of the risk of bias tools other than ROBINS-I, such as the misuse of outcome-based evaluation for study-based evaluation, and the few sensitivity analyses\/ subgroup analyses for the primary outcomes derived from the result of the RoB assessment [9, 10]. We hypothesize that the same may be true for ROBINS-I. The objective of this study is to describe how is the practice to assess RoB with ROBINS-I in SRs including NRSI.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1205927,"guid":"BFA78DF0DA7511EBAE26FBB169B4A393","previous_id":1205926,"previous_guid":"9C89D6C0DA7511EBAE26FBB169B4A393","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"839784EA496449DB9E1B7915C61F2915","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"MATERIALS AND METHODS"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"9F20B77BC1BD44F89DB17BEA7A92094C","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">This publication is the full study protocol.

If necessary, other review authors will arbitrate disagreements. After excluding some records in screening for title and abstract, we will check the eligibility criteria of full text whether reviews included NRSI and used ROBINS-I. Disagreements will be solved through discussion. If necessary, other review authors will arbitrate disagreements. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">ROBINS-I<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">ROBINS-I has seven domains: (1) bias due to confounding, (2) bias in selection of participants into the study, (3) bias in classification of intervention, (4) bias due to deviations from intended intervention, (5)bias due to missing data, (6) bias in measurement of outcomes, (7) bias in selection of the reported result [5]. The tool has signaling questions. The response options in each domain are (1) yes; (2) probably yes; (3) probably no; (4) no; and (5) no information. These response options of signaling questions will result in RoB value judgments. RoB value judgments are low risk of bias, moderate risk of bias, serious risk of bias, critical risk of bias, and no information [5]. Overall RoB judgments by ROBINS-I will be derived from RoB judgments for each domain as follows. A low risk of bias for overall risk of bias means \u201cthe study is judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains\u201d [5]. Moderate risk of bias for overall risk of bias means \u201cthe study is judged to be at low or moderate risk of bias for all domains\u201d [5]. Serious risk of bias for overall risk of bias means \u201cthe study is judged to be at serious risk of bias in at least one domain, but not at critical risk of bias in any domain\u201d [5]. Critical risk of bias for overall risk of bias means \u201cthe study is judged to be at critical risk of bias in at least one domain\u201d [5]. No information for overall risk of bias means \u201cthere is no clear indication that the study is at serious or critical risk of bias and there is a lack of information in one or more key domains of bias\u201d [5]. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Sample size<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We will perform random sampling and collect 100 samples from eligible non-Cochrane reviews.

To evaluate the practice to use the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool in systematic reviews (SRs) including non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Methods. This study is a meta-epidemiological study. We will include SRs, which include NRSI, and which used the ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias (RoB) for NRSI. We will exclude SRs if the results have no NRSI even if review authors plan to include NRSI. We will exclude protocols. We will limit SRs published since 2020. We will search PubMed to collect eligible SRs using the search term \u201cROBINS[tiab]\u201d AND the Systematic Review filter. We will perform random sampling and collect 100 samples from eligible non-Cochrane reviews. We will investigate eligible Cochrane reviews and the 100 non-Cochrane reviews and compare the characteristics. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Ethics & Dissemination.
