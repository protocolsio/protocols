First, we will ensure that newborn care is adequately captured in the search, as it may be missed in the search terms that exclusively or mainly focus on maternity care. Also, there is a lack of standardised and operational definition of \u201cexperience\u201d of newborn care. Newborns capacity to communicate their experience with care depends on health providers or carers\u2019 ability to interpret non-verbal cues. Unlike women, newborns lack the autonomy to make choices about their body or medical procedures. This adds an extra consideration when defining the concept of experience of newborn care as it becomes necessary to identify who advocates on behalf of newborns, and whether they discern between their own experience and that of the newborn. <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">This scoping review therefore seeks to cover two main concepts within the realm of quality of care. The first concept is the experience of newborn care which includes (1) the experience of the baby for which the mother\/parent\/carer or family act as a proxy voice such as the management of pain during invasive procedures (direct experience); (2) the experience of the newborns through biological indicators such as cortisol levels, sleep or cry patterns (observed experience); and (3) the experience of the mother\/parents\/carers and families with the care the newborn receives such as being informed about the procedures performed to the newborn (indirect experience). The second concept relates to the overall satisfaction of mother\/parents\/carers and families with the care the newborn received, which is understood as an outcome measure influenced by experience of care. Although there is an overlap between these concepts, as experiences may be shared by a newborn and the mother\/parents\/carers and families, there is a conceptual difference which should be accounted for when operationalizing and developing tools to measure them.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Standardized data on experience of care is essential to understanding the type of care women and newborns receive and to designing appropriate interventions\/responses. This review will build on ongoing work in the realm of maternity care and will complement it by assessing tools and indicators to measure experience of newborn care, and satisfaction with care during the postnatal period. <\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193208,"guid":"36755260C84111EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193203,"previous_guid":"61F4D6F0C84011EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"51B20431E8914AC1AB504DF872CAA909","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"REVIEW QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"7E479A24D9094B8BB87071936CB1DE61","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">REVIEW QUESTION: <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">What are the tools and indicators used to measure experience of newborn care and satisfaction with care during the postnatal period of the newborn?<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">OBJECTIVES:<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">To scope the range of available research literature on the measurements of experience of newborn care and satisfaction with newborn care during the postnatal period<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">To identify the main definitions and domains of experience of newborn care and satisfaction with newborn care during the postnatal period from the identified literature<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">To list tools and indicators used to assess experience of newborn care and satisfaction with newborn care during the postnatal period<\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">To map the available domains, tools and indicators according to predefined concepts of experience of newborn care and satisfaction with newborn care during the postnatal period<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#94EBFF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193211,"guid":"A64AC700C84111EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193208,"previous_guid":"36755260C84111EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"9B985AE81BC04316B19473D9D669ADCC","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"METHODS"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"4FFECC0388B04B4E8BAFAD376A4C0197","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">DEFINING CONCEPTS UNDER REVIEW<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span>The concepts being studied include (i)experience with postnatal care and (ii) satisfaction of mother\/parents\/carers or families with the care received by the newborn.

First, we will describe the characteristics of the tools and indicators following the authors\u2019 description. During this step, we will present the documents\u2019 definition of the concept under study (i.e. experience of care, satisfaction or mistreatment), the domains being measured (i.e. emotional support, unnecessary medical procedures, neglect, etc), and the tools, topic guides and indicators used to measure them. This first step will provide an overview of how the different concepts are understood and operationalized within the literature, while also providing a compendium of tools and indicators that could be available for future use. In this step we will also present the tools and indicators by (i) newborn condition at birth (small and sick newborns, by complications), (ii) by place of care of the newborn (NICU, community, other facility ward) and (iii) by geographical region. Other categorizations may also be performed as relevant (maternal age, infant sex, etc).<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">Second, we will map each domain measured in the included documents to one of the concepts under review (direct experience of care, indirect experience of care, mistreatment and satisfaction with care) based on the definitions presented above (refer to Defining concepts under review). Because we expect a lack of consensus on how the included document define and operationalize the concepts under review, this exercise will allow us to find a common understanding of what constitute experience of newborn care, mistreatment and satisfaction with care. As an output of this step, we will allocate the domains under each concept, jointly with the tools, topic guides and indicators used to measure them.<\/div><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193218,"guid":"EC88C610C84411EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193217,"previous_guid":"D47F5CA0C84411EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"72ADBE2995A2439BB37D37DC99BB5F7D","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"METHODS"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"41ADE437880D465BB394A9515419BAD8","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">REPORTING THE RESULTS<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Reporting, write-up and any publication generated from the scoping review will follow the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) format .<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:super;\">9<\/span><\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193219,"guid":"04C74940C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193218,"previous_guid":"EC88C610C84411EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"0F4A09079E754C3E8971725C1499FCF5","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"REVIEW TEAM MEMBERS AND AFFILIATIONS"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"FE2DA47AAB874229B6C36447F62B1AAF","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Nicole Minckas: Institute for Global Health, University College London, London, UK<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Emma Sacks: Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States of America<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Moise Muzigaba: Department for Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Ageing, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Anayda Portela: Department for Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Ageing, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#FFED92","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193220,"guid":"26A4B840C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193219,"previous_guid":"04C74940C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"AA58DB9C55204A1AB4776CA943762A08","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"CONFLICT OF INTEREST"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"736FBA5B84C84CE89B28ECEEDEAEB97D","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">We declare no conflict of interest<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#EA9F6C","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193221,"guid":"2F8228D0C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193220,"previous_guid":"26A4B840C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"A1B18544F4F942C7B1FBF3C23894AC1A","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"TIMELINE"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"D91F5DE3347A4F1BBB2CA6891071C4D7","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Anticipated or actual start date<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">July 2021<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Anticipated completion date<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">January 2022<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#E57785","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1193222,"guid":"620AB6A0C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","previous_id":1193221,"previous_guid":"2F8228D0C84511EBAD15BD310E512607","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"91C18B78E585494A82E894A85A1E5FC3","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"REFERENCES"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"62EEF3D264C541F788A7AA7F20C8E51F","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">1.
