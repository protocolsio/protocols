Rearing methods vary from being simple duplication of nature, such as holding insects and their feed resources to those where years of practice are required to tuning the optimal conditions. The vast majority of the rearing protocols are derived empirically from experimenting with a variety of materials and procedures until success is achieved. Because the determination of infestation caused by <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Megastigmus specularis, a seed-parasite, <\/span><span>on Fraser fir seeds and their relation to its parasitoid <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Mesopolobus,<\/span><span> are fundamental to biological control and related fields, accurate data are of great importance. Our method was established to obtain chalcid alive, using an economic and fast setting-up. This method has been used in our lab for different studies related to chalcids and their parasitoids. We present a very simple method to rear these species<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\"> <\/span><span>under laboratory conditions. The protocol can be used in experiments in which variation in day length and temperature is required. The rearing mounting can be easily placed in any laboratory or inside of a more controlled environment chamber and use inexpensive materials. This rearing method facilitates the observation and capture of adult insects while maximizing the number of experimental units (EUs) that could be evaluated. <\/span><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1591842306}
