However, in order to ensure the fluidity of self-consolidating concrete, Superplasticizer should be added to the concrete. In this test, PCA polycarboxylate superplasticizer was adopted to release free water in concrete slurry, so as to achieve the effect of water reduction. During construction, the water reducing admixture should be dissolved in water first, and then mixed with the gelatinous aggregate evenly [1].<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">(8) Admixture<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   Admixtures are added in the process of concrete mixing in order to improve the workability of concrete, ensure the micro expansion of concrete in the hardening process, avoid cracks due to shrinkage, and improve the working performance of self-consolidating concrete. ZW self-consolidating non-shrinkage concrete admixture (produced by Hunan Guli Engineering New Material Co., Ltd.) was adopted in this test, which was directly mixed with concrete and other gelatinous materials evenly to be used for construction.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">(9) Wooden formwork and mould<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\">   Before concrete pouring, a professional carpenter is required to make 60 sets of wood formwork, one set of five pieces.

If the mixer runs properly, use clean tap water to wet the inner wall of the mixer, so as to prevent the water-to-binder ratio of raw materials from changing due to the water absorption of the inner wall of the mixer. First, the coarse aggregate of sand and stone should be mixed in a forced concrete mixer for 5 minutes until they are evenly mixed, then the gelatinous materials such as fly ash, slag powder, concrete and self-consolidating concrete admixture are added to mix for 10 minutes until they are evenly mixed, finally the water-reducing admixture is dissolved in the tap water and added to the mixer to mix for 15 minutes.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/df3ybi96f.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   The formwork separation agent is applied evenly on the inner wall of the wood formwork and the mould, and the evenly mixed concrete is poured into the wood formwork and the mould respectively. A small vibrating rod is used to vibrate the concrete in the wooden formwork layer by layer until compacted. At the same time, the test cubes poured in the mould are placed on the vibrating table to vibrate until compacted, and wait for the natural closure.

After the initial setting of concrete, the test piece is demoulded and the test cubes and the test pieces are placed in the curing pond at constant temperature (60 \u2103) for 3 days. After that, the test pieces were taken out from the curing pond, watered at room temperature and covered with plastic film for 28 days. The test pieces used as control group for exploring the influence factors of rebound method and ultrasonic rebound method shall be additionally cured to 60 days and 90 days.<\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Rebound method, ultrasonic rebound comprehensive method, cube compressive strength test<\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   After 28 days of curing, the specimens were subjected to the ultrasonic, rebound, and cube compressive strength tests. The specific procedures are as follows:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">UPV measurement by the ultrasonic method<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   The ultrasonic method used a nonmetallic ultrasonic detector to measure the sound velocity. The cast surface of the specimen was used as a test surface, and the exact measurement point on the opposite surface of the specimen was located and coated with the coupling agent. Then, three sound velocities were measured at the ultrasonic measurement point, and their mean value was taken as the final sound velocity of the cube specimen [7,8]. The schematic diagram of the ultrasonic method test is shown in Fig 7.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/df4kbi96f.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Rebound measurement by the rebound method <\/span><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   A high-strength rebound meter with an impact energy of 4.5 J was used for the test. After the sound velocity measurement was completed, the test cube coated with the coupling agent was wiped clean and then placed on a press and subjected to a compression of 30 to 50 kN (with lower compression for lower grade concrete cubes). The pair of opposite surfaces not used in the sound velocity test were each subjected to a total of eight rebound strokes. During the rebound test, the rebound hammer was perpendicular to the measurement area, the compression was applied slowly, and the reading was reset quickly. The three maximum and three minimum values were eliminated, and the mean value of the remaining ten values was used as the representative rebound value R (accurate to 0.1) of the specimen. The rebound test is schematically shown in Fig 8. Fig 9 illustrates the distribution of the ultrasonic-rebound measurement points, with the ultrasonic measurement points labelled as \u201c1\u201d and the rebound measurement points labelled as \u201c2\u201d.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/df3ubi96f.jpg\" \/><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/df4qbi96f.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Cube compressive strength test<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   After the ultrasonic and rebound tests, each test cube was directly compressed to failure (Fig 10) at a compression rate of 8-10 kN\/s to obtain the compressive strength <\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">of the test cube (accurate to 0.1 MPa [9]).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:center\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/files\/df38bi96f.jpg\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">[1] Ministry of housing and urban rural development of the people's Republic of China.
