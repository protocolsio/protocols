These gram- negative bacteria from species like Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella, Vibrio and Helicobacter etc are among those that cause severe disease in consumers, especially those that indulge in uncooked seafood. Oysters have been shown to harbour these pathogenic organisms, which pose a major health risk. Numerous outbreaks of gastroenteritis due to oyster consumption have been reported worldwide because of the enteric bacteria as well as viral pathogen contamination<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This research was conducted to identify the Enterobacteriaceae present in oysters sold by vendors in Trinidad. During a five-month period (the rainy season, May - September), a total of 156 oyster samples (comprising 104 oysters samples and 52 water samples of the prepared, unprepared oyster cocktails plus the water used by vendors) were analysed. These samples were collected from roadside vendors operating near to the coastal line of the Western part of Trinidad These were processed at the microbiology unit of the Department of Para-clinical Sciences of the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine using standard microbiology techniques. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the recovered organisms were performed using the Kirby Bauer method for the following antibiotics- Tetracycline, Ampicillin, Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole, Cefuroxime and Ceftazidime. The SPSS 21 programme was used to analyse the biometric data and a chi-square test was used to determine if there was any significant difference between the kinds of preparation cocktails with respect to the coliform and organisms found.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Results of the 104 oyster samples tested, 112 isolates were obtained, 13.4% (15\/112) were E.coli of which 0.1% (1\/15) was the 0157:H7 strain; 72.3% (81\/112) were Shigella species of which 27.2% (22\/81) were Shigella dysenteriae; 14.3% (16\/112) were Salmonella species of which 25% (4\/16) were Salmonella cubana. The susceptibility profiles of the organisms revealed that 86.5% of Shigella, 100% of E.coli and 93.7% of the Salmonella were resistant to multiple antibiotics. With the recovery of these organisms from these samples, the health of the Trinidadian and foreign consumers of mangrove oysters is at risk particularly from Shigella, E.coli and Salmonella species. As a result, there should be an increased need for public awareness as well as regulations by the Ministry of Health to be made so that illness from these hazardous Enterobacteriaceae can be prevented.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1598074437}
