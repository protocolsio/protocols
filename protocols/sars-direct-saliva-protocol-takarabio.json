class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Abstract<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR has steadily increased since the COVID-19 pandemic began, resulting in the development of protocols for testing from a variety of biological matrices. Initial testing focused on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, which are invasive and require trained health care professionals to perform the sample collection, resulting in a bottleneck in testing. Saliva has emerged as a viable sample specimen for virus detection and can be self-collected with little instruction. Further, it has been demonstrated that virus detection is possible without the need for complex extraction protocols, including commercially available kits. However, a potential pitfall of available kits is the lack of comprehensive testing during development using contrived biological samples containing intact, heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in the appropriate matrix (e.g., saliva). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">We have found the Takara Direct One-Step RT-qPCR Mix for SARS-CoV-2 kit to be a cost-effective alternative for testing the direct detection of virus in saliva when compared with magnetic bead-assisted extraction systems, with minimal modifications from the manufacturers protocol. We have found that successful detection of virus requires the addition of a proteinase K digestion step, an increase of the reverse transcriptase time, and 3-step cycle (compared with a 2-step cycle in the manufacturers documentation). These changes allow for the successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus with a minimal increase in Ct values for RNase P and viral N-gene transcripts when compared with magnetic bead-assisted extractions kits. Implementing these critical steps will help end-users avoid false negatives. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Materials<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Zymo Proteinase K, 20 mg\/mL in storage buffer, store at +4 \u00b0C for 1 month or make aliquots and freeze for longer storage (Cat D3001-2-20, 20 mg)<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Takara Direct One-Step RT-qPCR Mix for SARS-CoV-2 (Cat 638329, 200 Rxns)<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">IDT SARS-CoV-2 CDC qPCR Probe Assay Kit (Cat 10006713, 500 Rxns)<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">IDT Plasmid Control, 2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control (Cat 10006625)<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">IDT Plasmid Control, Hs_RPP30 Positive Control (Cat 10006626)<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">SARS-CoV-2 External Control Kit (ATCC MP-32)<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Pooled human saliva (Lee Biosolutions, Cat 991-05-P-250) or self-collected saliva with IRB approval<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">Protocol<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;list-style-type:disc;\">A.

Initial testing focused on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, which are invasive and require trained health care professionals to perform the sample collection, resulting in a bottleneck in testing. Saliva has emerged as a viable sample specimen for virus detection and can be self-collected with little instruction. Further, it has been demonstrated that virus detection is possible without the need for complex extraction protocols, including commercially available kits. However, a potential pitfall of available kits is the lack of comprehensive testing during development using contrived biological samples containing intact, heat inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in the appropriate matrix (e.g., saliva). <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">\nWe have found the Takara Direct One-Step RT-qPCR Mix for SARS-CoV-2 kit to be a cost-effective alternative for testing the direct detection of virus in saliva when compared with magnetic bead-assisted extraction systems, with minimal modifications from the manufacturers protocol. We have found that successful detection of virus requires the addition of a proteinase K digestion step, an increase of the reverse transcriptase time, and 3-step cycle (compared with a 2-step cycle in the manufacturers documentation). These changes allow for the successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus with a minimal increase in Ct values for RNase P and viral N-gene transcripts when compared with magnetic bead-assisted extractions kits. Implementing these critical steps will help end-users avoid false negatives. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1617729053}
