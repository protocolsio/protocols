A total of 76.1% of the cases corresponded to women. The majority were classified as type A (55.0%) and B (28.9%), and 16.7% were serious cases. The respiratory tract was the most commonly affected organ system (16.8%), followed by the skin and adnexa (15.6%). Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory drugs accounted for 70.6% of the reports, and the drugs related to the greatest number of ADRs were adalimumab (12.2%) and etanercept (11.6%).<\/span><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Conclusions:<\/span><span> There has been an incremental increase in the reporting of ADRs associated with the use of biotech drugs in the pharmacovigilance program, related to the strengthening and appropriation of the patient safety culture and improvement in the quality of the generated information.
