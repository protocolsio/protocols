The amplified mutant type DNA is detected by intercalating dye. PNAClamp analysis was performed using PNAClampTMEGFR Mutation Detection Kit (Panagene, Deajeon, Korea) following the manual provided by the manufacturer. Both kits have the same procedure and protocol. In summary, 7 \u00b5l of DNA template, 3 \u00b5l of each PNA mix, and 10 \u00b5l of 2X premix are mixed for a single amplification reaction. The amplification of the mixture (20 \u00b5l) was performed in CFX96 real-time PCR instrument (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) with the following thermal program: a pre-incubation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min. and 40-cycles amplification (94\u00b0C for 30 sec.; 70\u00b0C for 30 sec.; 63\u00b0C for 30 sec.; and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec). Detection of signal of intercalating dye was measured at every 63\u00b0C steps. Ct value for the reaction (Sample Ct value) is determined based on the fluorescence values measured at every 63\u00b0C steps. If a mutation occurs in a specific codon site, it is not hybridized and amplified so that the Ct value is low. Assessment of the result was determined according to the delta(\u0394): Ct value which was calculated according to each kit manual. The \u0394Ct is obtained from [standard Ct value minus Ct value obtained from an unknown sample]. The presence of each codon mutation is confirmed by the unique value of \u0394Ct.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"section":null,"section_color":"","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":860655,"guid":"B228ACF01EDC11EA936EDDF5082E72CA","previous_id":860654,"previous_guid":"AB61E7601EDC11EA936EDDF5082E72CA","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"7471DC7027EB427FB85E74166E8CFBF4","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":""}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"3A2377CF832B4822950713E46CA17334","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Statistical analysis<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">All continuous variables were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and categorical variables were presented as number (%).
