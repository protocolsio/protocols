This protocol is intended for research purposes only, using specially-formulated monomeric alpha-synuclein protein available for purchase at Proteos, Inc as the result of efforts by The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF). Each batch of the \u201cAlpha-Synuclein Monomer Protein for Making Pre- Formed Fibrils\u201d has undergone internal purification and quality control at Proteos in addition to external validation to confirm successful generation of pathogenic aSyn PFFs. See Reference section for methods and results from application of alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibrils (aSyn PFFs) in primary neuron cultures in vitro or in mice in vivo. This protocol is referenced in the Polinski et al 2018 paper entitled \"Best Practices for Generating and Using Alpha-Synuclein Pre-Formed Fibrils to Model Parkinson's Disease in Rodents\" (doi: 10.3233\/JPD-171248).<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1629210939}
