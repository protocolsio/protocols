As so, it is essential to share the housing and husbandry details of laboratories in scientific papers. Unfortunately, most of the times, these details are overlooked and just referred as \u201estandard holding conditions\u201d. As these conditions can have strong effect on the animals and could be different between and within facilities (even between different rooms in the same facility), the absence of housing and husbandry details in scientific papers could limit the reproducibility of the studies. To be as informative as possible, we are thus providing the details of the housing and husbandry conditions of zebrafish (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">Danio rerio<\/span><span>) used in projects at the University of Glasgow during 2017 \u2013 2020.
