To date, no data have been published in Germany on the attendance of antenatal classes by women with elective CS, nor are the reasons for their attendance or non-attendance known. Antenatal classes offer pregnant women a lot of valuable information beyond the topic of vaginal birth, therefore they are also important for pregnant women with elective CS. The study will explore the demand for antenatal classes among pregnant women with elective CS from the midwives perspective, along with factors that either hinder or promote their attendance. Additionally, the study aims to assess the information needs of pregnant women with elective CS in antenatal classes from the midwives' perspective and how these information needs could be addressed better in antenatal classes as well as the extent to which (elective) CS is covered in antenatal classes.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":1,\"length\":11}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"7bd0p\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"2r6qv\",\"text\":\"Methods: The study population consists of midwives who practice in Germany, currently provide antenatal classes and are experienced in giving antenatal classes.
