This is a representative sample of the islet preparation that has been distributed to investigators and is held at the distributing center as a quality control sample. The islets are cultured in the same shipping media used for islet shipment, for 18 hours at 4-8\u00b0C, simulating the cold shipping conditions followed by 2 days at 37\u00b0C culture.
