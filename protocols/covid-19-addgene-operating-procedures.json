An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections. Antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection; they show an immune response to the infection. A positive test means you had the disease at some point in the past. Currently there is no definitive community understanding if a positive result in an antibody test means you can\u2019t get infected again (like if you have had chicken pox you don\u2019t get it again). The different tests may also measure different antibodies further confusing the research on this. If you do test positive for anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, one still needs to observe all safety precautions.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Procedures<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Review and sign SOP number EHS-001<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">Return signed SOP via e-mail to your supervisor, the project team lead and the Lab Operations Manager<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Approval of On-Site Work<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span>Employees must review <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1YLzDbUiaTMMEOHOQgE0QAhJvhZxeIoHG69Elv6ipjbk\/edit#slide=id.p1\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">safety training presentation<\/span><\/a><span> with Facilities Team before working onsite<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span>Onsite staff must be listed as an onsite worker (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1eJM5Iq_cRfbO7qIcBIB0cpYeoH-PZ4MU3wG89RaLnZc\/edit?usp=sharing\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">onsite worker schedule<\/span><\/a><span>).<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\">For occasional \u201cdrop-in\u201d visits to the office by offsite staff, access must be requested by contacting Facilities Lead in advance of a visit by Slack or Email.<\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Self-Assessment<\/span><\/li><li style = \"counter-reset:ol0;\"><span>All employees who are scheduled to work on site, are required to complete the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1uDe--ccNqJ812ASTKKcYe9Lu1if8Vi_mtLs1tBQKCVU\/edit?usp=sharing\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;:UNDERLINE;\">self-assessment questionnaire<\/span><\/a><span> prior to their scheduled start time.

An antibody test looks for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made in response to infections.

Currently there is no definitive community understanding if a positive result in an antibody test means you can\u2019t get infected again (like if you have had chicken pox you don\u2019t get it again). The different tests may also measure different antibodies further confusing the research on this.
