However, isolation of the region-specific mechanisms underlying these relationships is limited by our lack of precise maps of skeletal innervation. We developed an optimized workflow for imaging of nerve axons in and around the bone, resulting in novel, comprehensive maps of sympathetic adrenergic and sensory peptidergic axons within and around the full length of the femur and tibia in two strains of mice (B6 and C3H). This protocol is intended to serve as a guide during the design, implementation, and interpretation of future neuroskeletal studies and was compiled as a resource for the field as part of the NIH SPARC consortium.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1625933171}
