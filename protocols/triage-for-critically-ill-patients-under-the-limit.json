The rapidly increased number of patients sometimes exceed medical resource capacity. Under the scarce resource situation, clinicians may need to allocate medical resources to selected populations. However, there are no established triage criteria. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review to map the reported triage\u00a0available. We formulated the following primary review question:\u00a0\u00a0What kind of criteria and algorithms are available for clinicians to triage patients in the resource scarcity setting during the disease pandemic like COVID-19?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Methods and analysis <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">For conducting the scoping review protocol, we will use a scoping review methodology established in the Joanna Briggs Institute manual. We also will use the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews to assess the results. The concept of our review will be the triage criteria, systems, or algorithms used for the allocation of medical resources to selected populations among patients with the pandemic disease.\u00a0The context of our review will be the resource scarcity setting during disease pandemic like COVID-19. We will conduct the systematic search on MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane controlled register of trials (CENTRAL) and include studies that incorporate critically ill patients due to the pandemic disease itself. We will summarize the studies based on the characteristics and efficiency (if applicable) of triages.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Ethics and dissemination <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Since this is a review of the literature, ethics approval is not mandated. We will publish the results from this review in peer-reviewed journals.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1587260592}
