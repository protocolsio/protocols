Besides, with respect to the periorbital region, it is invariably the earliest appearance area of the facial aging phenomenon. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this technique.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library databases on November 11, 2020, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, to identify all relevant articles. Then, a data extraction and standardization process was performed to assess all outcome data. Ultimately, the data were assessed using a random effects regression model with comprehensive meta-analysis software. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Results: Thirty-six studies consisting of four cohorts and 32 case series with a total of 3997 cases were included. The mean follow-up was 1.5 years. Meta-analysis revealed a relatively high satisfaction rate of 93.7% (95% CI, 89.6%\u201396.2%). Frequent complications in 3997 patients receiving AFG were edema, chemosis, and contour irregularity, with an overall complication rate of 7.7% (95% CI, 4.3%\u201313.3%).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that AFG for rejuvenation of eyelids and periorbital area provided a high satisfaction rate and did not result in severe complications. Therefore, AFG might be performed safely for periorbital rejuvenation and reconstruction.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1614336775}
