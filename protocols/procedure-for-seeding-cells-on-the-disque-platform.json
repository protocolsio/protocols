These prodrugs were identified through screening on the Disque Platform (DP)\u2014a high-fidelity culture system where stem cell\u2013derived \u03b2 cells are reaggregated into thin, 3D discs within 2D 96-well plates that mimic in vivo conditions.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">The Disque Platform allows for the formation of 3D micro-tissues within an automation-friendly design, and is capable of systematically manipulating the cell niche in order to identify chemical and physical cues that enhance\u00a0\u03b2\u00a0cell proliferation. The Disque Platform better replicates the zinc content of native islets, enabling for the screening of zinc-activated prodrugs whose activity cannot be detected in 2D culture systems, which typically display a markedly lowered zinc content. The Disque Platform is a reliable screening platform that bridges the advantages of 2D and 3D culture systems and responds to interventions when conventional systems cannot produce a clear signal or readout.
