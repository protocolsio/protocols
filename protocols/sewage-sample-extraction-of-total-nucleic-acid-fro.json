The sample undergoes a lysate preparation process and includes mechanical disruption (bead beating), removal of inhibitors, purification and elution of DNA and RNA using spin columns. Extrinsic controls PhHV (Phocine Herpesvirus) and MS2 are added to each sample during the lysate preparation to evaluate extraction and amplification efficiency. The extracted total nucleic acid (TNA) is then stored at -80\u00b0C for testing. To rule out contamination during the extraction process, a blank is also processed through the complete protocol each day extractions are performed.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1622083069}
