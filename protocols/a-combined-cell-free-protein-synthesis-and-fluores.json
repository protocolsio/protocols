In this context, we present two methods for the site-specific fluorescent labeling of difficult-to-express membrane proteins in combination with cell-free protein synthesis. The cell-free protein synthesis system is based on Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO) since this system contains endogenous membrane structures derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. These so-called microsomes enable a direct integration of membrane proteins into a biological membrane. In this protocol the first part describes the fluorescent labeling by using a precharged tRNA, loaded with a fluorescent amino acid. The second part describes the preparation of a modified aminoacyl-tRNA-synthetase and a suppressor tRNA that are applied to the CHO cell-free system to enable the incorporation of a non-canonical amino acid. The reactive group of the non-canonical amino acid is further coupled to a fluorescent dye. Both methods utilize the amber stop codon suppression technology. The successful fluorescent labeling of the model G protein-coupled receptor adenosine A2A (Adora2a) is analyzed by in-gel-fluorescence, a reporter protein assay, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Moreover, a ligand-dependent conformational change of the fluorescently labeled Adora2a was analyzed by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET).<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1632316292}
