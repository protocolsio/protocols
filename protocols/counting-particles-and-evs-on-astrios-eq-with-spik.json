Common counting methods are resistive pulse sensing (RPS) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). RPS uses the Coulter principle to derive size from the measurable changes in electrical impedance produced by nonconductive particles suspended in an electrolyte. NTA uses tracks the movement of particles by Brownian motion allowing the calculation of their diameter using the Stokes-Einstein equation. Concentration can also be calculated by using the number of particles tracked per detection window volume. This technique requires the use of a specific instrument that may not be available to the broad scientific community on regular basis. Here, we describe an alternative method for counting particles in a solution, where spherical polystyrene fluorescent beads of known concentration are used as spike in reference materials. This method however depends upon the accuracy of the bead stock concentration.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1603473836}
