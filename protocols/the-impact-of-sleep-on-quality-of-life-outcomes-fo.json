Another major issue is sleep apnea, which has high global prevalence [1] and is associated with a greater risk of  nocturia [3] and erectile dysfunction [4]. Previous studies have examined the relationship between sleep disorders with cancer risk, including prostate cancer. Pooled results by Liu et al. found that neither short sleep nor long sleep was associated with the risk of prostate cancer [5]. A separate systematic review reported no significant relationship between short or long sleep duration with prostate cancer-specific mortality [6]. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    Another important consideration is maximizing quality of life for cancer survivors. While studies have shown a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances among people with cancer, many have focused on breast cancer [7]. Less is known about the prevalence of sleep health problems among patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, or their family caregivers, and the relationship of sleep health with quality of life. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Objective<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    The objective of this review is to address the following questions: (1) What is the impact of prostate cancer on sleep for patients and caregivers? (2) Among adult men with prostate cancer and their caregivers, how does sleep impact such psychosocial and physical activity factors as quality of life, cognitive impairment, depression and anxiety?<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Inclusion Criteria <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    Inclusion criteria include primary research studies and secondary analyses from larger studies that assess the impact of prostate cancer on sleep among patients with prostate cancer and\/or their caregivers. To be eligible for this systematic review, studies will include: (1) patients diagnosed with prostate cancer or caregivers of patients with prostate cancer; and (2) subjective or objective measurement of sleep. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Exclusion Criteria <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    Studies will be excluded if they do not sleep data specifically for patients with prostate cancer or their caregivers (e.g., aggregate sleep responses among patients with a variety of cancer diagnoses, or caregivers of patients with a variety of cancer diagnoses), if only fatigue is measured instead of sleep, and if the paper is a conference abstract and not a full manuscript. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Outcomes of Interest<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">    The primary outcomes of interest include subjective or objective measures of sleep among patients with prostate cancer and\/or their caregivers. This includes data on sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep latency, and sleep disturbances.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Search Strategy<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">   A systematic literature search will be conducted by a medical librarian according to the PRISMA guidelines. The databases will include PubMed\/Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library (encompassing the clinical trials registries), Biosis Citation Index (BCI), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), Web of Science, Food Science & Technology Abstracts, and APA PsycINFO. No date or language limits will be applied. Bibliographies of included studies will be reviewed for additional references. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Electronic Searches<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     The search will be done using the following strategy: (prostatic neoplasms OR prostatic neoplasm OR prostate cancer OR prostate neoplasms) AND (sleep OR insomnia).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Data Screening<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     Records will be identified utilizing the search strategy outlined above. Two reviewers will independently screen all records based on titles and abstracts using Covidence. The full texts of potentially eligible articles will be independently reviewed using a standardized Google form. Disagreements will be resolved through consensus discussion with co-authors. Bibliographies of these selected articles will be analyzed for further eligible articles. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Quality Evaluation and Data Analysis<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">     Eligible studies will be independently assessed for quality utilizing the Hawker et al. quality assessment checklist, with 9 items rated from 1-4.[8]  Quality scores (range, 9-36) will be tabulated by summing the results. <\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Funding sources\/sponsors<\/span><span>: The Prostate Cancer Foundation, the NYU Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center Support Grant\u2019s Developmental Project Program (P30CA016087), and the Edward Blank and Sharon Cosloy-Blank Family Foundation <\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Conflicts of Interest<\/span><span>: The authors have no related conflict of interest to disclose.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">References<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>[1].
