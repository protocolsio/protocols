<\/span><span>Acute cardiovascular diseases including acute coronary syndrome, acute decompensated heart failure, and acute aortic diseases are leading causes of death in acute clinical settings. Quality indicators are widely used in cardiovascular field to assess and improve the quality of care, but there was no comprehensive review which summarize and assess the currently used quality indicators for acute cardiovascular diseases.<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Methods and analysis: <\/span><span>The scoping review will be performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) statement.
