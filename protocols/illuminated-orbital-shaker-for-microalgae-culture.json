We solved the problem by building a stand-alone orbital shaking incubator with an in-built variable light source and a 24-hour timer. The shaker features a homogeneously illuminated growth area of 20 cm \u00d7 15 cm, which is suitable for three T75 tissue culture flasks or four 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks.
