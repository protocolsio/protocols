If a female participant becomes pregnant following randomization, she will be encouraged to complete remaining visits and study procedures (except for any remaining investigational product dosing) unless medically contraindicated. The investigator is required to notify the contract research organization (CR)O within 24 hours of knowledge of a pregnancy. Any participant who becomes pregnant during the period between vaccination and the last study visit will continue to be followed for pregnancy outcome, even if birth occurs after the scheduled end of the study for the subject.  The pregnancy and its outcome will be reported on the Pregnancy CRF.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#A492FF","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0},{"id":1012798,"guid":"A2033650E6B511EA9F81B3152C178714","previous_id":1010432,"previous_guid":"0DCF9D10E40911EA8B73B99A3050F1CC","modified_on":0,"protocol_id":0,"components":[{"id":1054723,"guid":"3BB7F351F9D74968931500DA8844CDF0","order_id":1,"type_id":6,"title":"Section","source":{"title":"First vaccination visit (Day 1)"}},{"id":1054724,"guid":"F4F0546E91AC4A8FBC7B4034ED08DC1E","order_id":1,"type_id":1,"title":"description","source":{"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\">Check inclusion and exclusion criteria.<\/div><\/div>"}}],"cases":[],"data":null,"html":null,"section":null,"section_color":"#84CE84","section_duration":0,"critical":null,"critical_id":null,"duration":0}],"document":null,"materials":[],"description":"<div class = \"text-blocks\"><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This is part 6 of: \"Phase 3 randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of <\/span><span style = \"font-weight:bold;\">Vaccine Candidate<\/span><span> against COVID-19 in adults > 18 years of age\"<\/span><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">This generic Phase 3 protocol was developed by the PATH team with support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
