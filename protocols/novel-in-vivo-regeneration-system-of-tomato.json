However, many elite commercial cultivars are difficult to culture and regenerate. We need In-depth regeneration mechanism research to address the barrier. Here, we developed a simple, high-efficiency tomato in vivo regeneration method through removing all shoot apex of an intact tomato plant. This indirect regeneration via an intermediate callus phase are not introduced by plant growth regulators. We propose that this process can be used as a model system to investigate the mechanisms that regulate indirect regeneration of higher plants.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1608307566}
