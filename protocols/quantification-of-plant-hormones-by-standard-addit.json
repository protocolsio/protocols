Simultaneous quantification of multiple plant hormones is required for understanding plant physiology because hormones typically change in tandem in response to external stimuli. Sensitive and quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) adopts stable isotope-labeled compounds in previously published works. However, a method for quantifying phytohormones when isotopically labeled chemicals are not available, remains to be established.<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>This protocol can be used for measuring plant hormone content by standard addition method. Standard addition method has been used for quantification of various compounds such as drugs and pesticides especially when it is difficult to obtain stable isotope-labeled compounds.
