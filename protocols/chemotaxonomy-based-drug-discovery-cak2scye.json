This relies on information management and data mining of the enormous amounts of biological, chromatographic and spectroscopic data generated in modern drug discovery. To optimize the drug discovery process, the cultures of a given microbial collection (culture collection or natural samples) are selected for extraction and biological evaluation. Microbial strains have been selected based on morphology, and with more powerful approaches such as automated image analysis of pure cultures, phenotypic characters including production of secondary
