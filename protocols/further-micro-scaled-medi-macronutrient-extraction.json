version of the original MEDI protocol. The further micro-scaled protocol is intended particularly for invertebrates of dry volumes of 1 mg or less which cannot be pooled together given their scarcity or the focus of the study precluding pooling (e.g., investigation of individual differences). The micro-scaling is achieved by increasing analyte concentration at both the extraction and analysis stages, therefore facilitating more sensitive detection of macronutrients.
