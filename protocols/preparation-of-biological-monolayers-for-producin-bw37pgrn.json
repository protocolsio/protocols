Correct preparation of SEM samples can provide an unprecedented understanding of the nexus between cellular morphology and topography. This comparative study critically examines two coating methods for preparing biological samples for scanning electron microscopy, while also providing novel advice on how to prepare in vitro epithelial or endothelial samples for high-resolution scanning-electron microscopy (HR-SEM). Two obstacles often confront the biologist when investigating cellular structures grown under tissue culture conditions, viz., how to prepare and present the biological samples to the HR-SEM microscope without affecting topographical membrane and cellular structural alterations. Firstly, our use of the Millicell cellulose inserts on which to grow our cellular samples in preparation for HR-SEM is both novel and advantageous to comparing the permeability function of cells to their morphological function. Secondly, biological material is often non-conducting, thermally sensitive and fragile and, therefore, needs to be fixed correctly and coated with thin conducting metal to ensure high-resolution detail of samples. Immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd5) was used as a basis for describing the preferences in the use of the protocol. We compare two biological sample coating modalities for the visualizing and analysis of texturized, topographical, membranous ultrastructures of brain endothelial cell (BEC) confluent monolayers, namely, carbon and gold:palladium (Au:Pd) sputter coating in preparation for HR-SEM. BEC monolayers sputter-coated with these two modalities produced three-dimensional micrographs which have distinctly different topographical detail from which the nanostructural cellular data can be examined. The two coating methods display differences in the amount of nanoscopic detail that could be resolved in the nanosized membrane cytoarchitecture of BEC monolayers. The micrographical data clearly showed that Au:Pd sputter-coated samples generate descript imagery, providing useful information for profiling membrane nanostructures compared to carbon-coated samples. The recommendations regarding the contrast in two modalities would provide the necessary guidance to biological microscopists in preparing tissue culture samples for HR-SEM.\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"italic\",\"offset\":431,\"length\":8}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"entityMap\":{}}","disclaimer":"","document":"{\"blocks\":[{\"key\":\"6thp1\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"a6dqb\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"ap85\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1glg1\",\"text\":\"Materials and methods\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":21}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"5fgs6\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"f9dq6\",\"text\":\"High-resolution scanning electron microscopy\",\"type\":\"unstyled\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":44}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"akqj8\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-justify\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"9bj9q\",\"text\":\"When using HR-SEM, the signal generating the image occurs as a result of the interaction of the primary electron beam with the biological specimen.

The surface-emitted SEs are detected by a scintillator-based Everhart-Thornley detector (ETD), also known as secondary or SE detector.

Closer inspection reveals that the carbon film roughness is more pronounced compared to the Au:Pd 80:20 coatings of Fig 3 as the spikes in the profiles are more closely spaced and more frequent compared to the Au:Pd coatings. In addition, from the optical images of Fig 5, the carbon film integrity is of inferior quality than the Au:Pd films, which had high reflectivity indicative of a compact layer. A simple swab test also reveals that the carbon film is more powdered compared to the metal layers, as they delaminate far easier from the glass slides than the Au:Pd sputtered films. This is to be expected and can be explained by the relative chamber pressures (viz; the metal coatings were deposited in a cleaner chamber (10-6 mbar) compared to the carbon coating at a pre-deposition vacuum of (10-3 mbar)). Based on the above analysis, a standard sample distance of 25 mm was maintained for all specimens, implying a nominal carbon coating of 16 nm.\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":82,\"length\":5},{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":352,\"length\":5},{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":502,\"length\":5},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":965,\"length\":2},{\"style\":\"sup\",\"offset\":1038,\"length\":2}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"3senj\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"19olt\",\"text\":\"Acknowledgements\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":16}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"a7v9n\",\"text\":\"This work was supported by the infrastructural and academic support provided by the Department of Medical Biosciences at the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and the Electron Microscopy Unit at the University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa.\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"cjas3\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"flrqf\",\"text\":\"\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"1of8n\",\"text\":\"References:\",\"type\":\"align-left\",\"depth\":0,\"inlineStyleRanges\":[{\"style\":\"bold\",\"offset\":0,\"length\":11}],\"entityRanges\":[],\"data\":{}},{\"key\":\"49mnk\",\"text\":\"El Azzouzi M, Khouchaf L, Achahbar A.
