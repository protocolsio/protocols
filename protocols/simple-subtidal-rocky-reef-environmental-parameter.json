This low-cost method has been used in several studies for measuring water motion in subtidal habitats (e.g. Watson, 1976; Leichter and Witman, 1997; Irving and Connell, 2002; Connell, 2005). All measures were made simultaneously at all rocky reefs while one alabaster block was deployed inside a 20 L recipient to serve as control as recommended byJokiel and Morrissey (1993). <\/li><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><ul style = \"list-style-type:disc;\"><\/ul><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><\/div><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:left\"><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span>  <\/span><\/div><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/protocols-files\/public\/585a4b39ed95eae71614d5629ddfdce57d3b4767a234b98ee8814e36dd531c13\/b9pc4jke.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">References:<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><span>    Connell, S.
