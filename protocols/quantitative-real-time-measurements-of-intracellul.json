Within the milieu of cells, strong affinity may be required to overcome competition from endogenous metabolites or enzymatic substrates that may compete directly with the tracer. Second, the intrinsic binding kinetics of tracer for the target may also be important for consideration. In general, compounds with rapid equilibration kinetics also offer better capabilities for real-time analysis of target engagement (i.e., residence time analysis). Finally, the base scaffold must have a solvent exposed reactive group for conjugation. This site can be determined through cocrystal structure, SAR analysis, or homology models. Although a variety of synthetic approaches can be employed, NanoBRET(TM) dyes prepared as activated esters can be readily conjugated to the scaffold via a primary or secondary aliphatic amine. These amine groups have been shown to react quickly and quantitatively with activated ester dyes and amino acid linkers.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">A variety of dye classes have been evaluated in BRET assay formats, and dyes representing two fluorophore classes (Fig. 2a) have been identified that demonstrate consistently robust cell permeability and optimal spectral overlap for energy transfer. Derivatives containing varied linkers and dyes may perform differently in the assay (examples provided in Fig. 2). Therefore, as a starting point for assay development, it is initially recommended that at least four derivatives be prepared and evaluated in the BRET configuration: Minimal\/no linker derivatives conjugated to NanoBRET\u2122 618 and NanoBRET\u2122 590 dyes and extended linkers (e.g., multi-PEG or alkyl derivatives) conjugated to NanoBRET\u2122 618 and NanoBRET\u2122 590 dyes. This panel of tracer candidates can be created from common intermediates and will provide structural diversity required to ensure the highest probability of success, and if required, guide further optimization. To serve as examples, these principles have been employed to create a panel of candidate cell-permeable tracers based on crizotinib, a multikinase inhibitor scaffold (Fig. 3).<\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/media.springernature.com\/lw785\/springer-static\/image\/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8891-4_3\/MediaObjects\/432341_1_En_3_Fig3_HTML.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Fig. 3<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Chemical structures of four candidate tracer derivatives based upon the crizotinib scaffold.

In general, compound affinity is measured under steady-state conditions between the test compound, the tracer, and the intracellular target protein. For the simple determination of compound rank-order affinity, it is recommended to use the tracer at a fixed concentration approximating 50\u221280% occupancy at the target. However, tracers can be exploited to provide a more quantitative apparent affinity value, as engagement potency is often dependent on the concentration and affinity of the tracer used in the assay. As the tracer and test compound bind to the target in a competitive and mutually exclusive manner, the relationship between the apparent IC<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">50<\/span><span>of the test compound and the concentration of tracer used in the assay is governed by the Cheng\u2013Prusoff Equation [8] (Eq. 2).<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span style = \":;\">\n<\/span><a href=\"#\" style = \"text-decoration:underline;color:blue;cursor:pointer;\"><span style = \":;\"> <\/span><\/a><span> (2)<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><span style = \"\">K_{i,app} = \\frac{IC_{50}}{1 + \\frac{[tracer]}{K_{d,app}}}<\/span><\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Equation 2 provides the quantitative capability to extract an apparent dissociation constant (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;vertical-align:sub;\">K<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">i,app<\/span><span>) for the test compound.

For example, if the apparent affinity of the tracer (<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;vertical-align:sub;\">K<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">d,app<\/span><span>) has already been measured, Eq. 2 can be used to convert an IC<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;\">50 <\/span><span>value measured at a single, known concentration of tracer to the <\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;vertical-align:sub;\">K<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">i,app <\/span><span>for the test compound.

Accordingly, compounds that are similarly active in biochemical, cellular target engagement, and cellular activity assays can be assigned highest priority, while those that are very weak or inactive in a cellular target engagement assay, yet active in the other two formats, should be binned as suspicious. Such compounds are likely to trigger cellular activity assay inhibition through indirect effects. A sensitive cellular target engagement assay may also show correlative activity with the biochemical assay for certain compounds, yet fail to demonstrate cellular activity. In this case, the compound or compound series may be valid, yet require chemical optimization to allow cellular activity. It would therefore be valuable to apply the NanoBRET\u2122 target engagement assay for HTS and as a key aid for dissection of mechanism in lead optimization.<\/div><br\/><div class = \"text-block\">It is possible to configure the steps and equipment to higher throughput, in order to enable efficient intracellular target engagement-based HTS and lead optimization. In order to afford the throughput required for HTS and lead optimization, several steps to streamline the NanoBRET\u2122 process are suggested. Strategies to maximize efficiency include switching from 96-well to 384-well format to reduce the number of plates required and the plate \u201creal estate\u201d occupied by controls, reducing the number of steps by using assay-ready plates, and implementation of robotic liquid handling protocols.

The energy transfer technique can be readily configured to measure real-time binding kinetics in live cells, thus providing an approach to assess drug residence in an artificial open system. The open system can be simulated by applying an acute treatment of test compound to the cells, followed by removal of unbound compound and a real-time measurement of residence time using energy transfer (Fig. 8).<\/span><\/div><div style = \"text-align :; float : ;\"><img style = \"\" src = \"https:\/\/media.springernature.com\/lw785\/springer-static\/image\/chp%3A10.1007%2F978-1-4939-8891-4_3\/MediaObjects\/432341_1_En_3_Fig8_HTML.png\" \/><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Fig. 8<\/div><div class = \"text-block\">Illustration of BRET for intracellular residence time analysis<\/div><br\/><br\/><div class = \"text-block\"><span>Prior to performing a residence time analysis, it is important to determine a few key parameters. First, it is important to select an optimal tracer and determine a working concentration of the tracer for BRET measurement after compound washout. In general, it is recommended to use a saturating concentration of tracer that has fast association and dissociation kinetics with the target of interest. While this may be achievable in practice, the binding of the tracer might not be saturable for some targets. Thus, it is important to optimize the association kinetics at the highest tracer concentration possible. For new tracers and\/or new target combinations, it is recommended to initially evaluate the kinetic parameters in a dose-responsive manner to ensure that an optimal tracer and working concentration are selected for the downstream residence time analysis. This is accomplished via observed rate constant (<\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;vertical-align:sub;\">k<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">obs<\/span><span>) analysis, wherein the establishment of BRET at the target is measured kinetically over time at increasing tracer concentrations. Subsequently, the <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;vertical-align:sub;\">k<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">obs <\/span><span>is determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the kinetic curves for each tracer concentration using the one-phase association equation (Eq. 4), assuming pseudo-first order association [12]. The <\/span><span style = \"font-style:italic;vertical-align:sub;\">k<\/span><span style = \"vertical-align:sub;\">obs <\/span><span>values are replotted with respect to tracer concentration, which yields a linear relationship.
