To determine statistical differences between groups, we used the Chi-square test or Fischer\u2019s exact test for categorical variables and the t-test or Mann\u2013Whitney test for continuous variables. We used Z-test to compare the frequency of postoperative pain.<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\">Statistical analyses were carried out using the Stata program, version 13 (2013, Stata statistical<\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><div class = \"text-block\">software: StataCorp, College Station, TX).<\/div><div class = \"text-block\"><div class = \"justify\" style = \"text-align:justify\"><\/div><style>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  .justify:after {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    content: \"\";\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    display:inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    width: 100%;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/style><\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1617446105}
