In the 1980s, its application rangewas developing\u00a0from basic research to clinical medical research and disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring. It set of optics, electronics, fluid mechanics, cell chemistry, biology, immunology. At the same time, it has the function of analyzing and sorting cells, and can quickly analyze the cell suspension. The light scattering and fluorescence indices of the cells were obtained by detecting the single row of cells in the flowing liquid one by one.<\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1612701770}
