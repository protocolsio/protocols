In the guinea pig, recurrent laryngeal afferent fibers are primarily responsible for cough in response to mechanical or chemical stimulation of the upper trachea and larynx. Further, it has been proposed that lower airway slowly adapting receptors have a permissive effect on the cough reflex. The objective of this study was to determine the role of lower airway vagal afferent fibers on the cough reflex in the cat. We hypothesized that cough induced by mechanical or chemical stimuli applied to the lower airways or the larynx of this species would be depressed after vagotomy below the branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Experiments were conducted in four anesthetized, bilaterally thoracotomized, and artificially ventilated cats. Artificial ventilation was accomplished via a tracheal cannula placed through an incision in the tenth trachea ring. Mechanical (via a flexible cannula through a small port in the trachea tube) or chemical (capsaicin, 0.5 cc, 10 \u00b5M) stimulation of the intrathoracic airway was employed during mechanical ventilation. Thoracic vagotomy virtually eliminated the cough response to mechanical stimulation of the lower airways. The cough response to mechanical stimulation of the larynx was also depressed after thoracic vagotomy. Capsaicin introduced into the intrathoracic trachea only elicited cough in two animals but this response was eliminated in both animals by thoracic vagotomy. The results support an important role of lower airway sensory feedback in the production of cough in the anesthetized cat. Further, in the presence of intact recurrent laryngeal nerves, the excitability of cough induced from the larynx is strongly influenced by sensory feedback from the lower airways. <\/div><\/div>","changed_on":1589923307}
